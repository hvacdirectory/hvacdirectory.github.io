<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter can worsen issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating unit can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your home. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it's important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that might be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality issue is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated issues-- recognized by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the three strategies listed below may be suitable.<p>
