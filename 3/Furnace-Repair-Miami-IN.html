However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can determine an issue that will require a considerable investment to correct. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the expensive repair and delight in ongoing convenience from your existing heating unit? Or, do you make an even bigger monetary commitment to replacing the furnace? The decision to repair or replace depends on you, and often it refers comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the devices, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely offers greater energy performance and features guarantee coverage.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists used different methodologies. The CMHC research study contacted numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they belonged to a study, and the researchers did not control for time spent or methods used. The EPA study prescribed and controlled methods utilized on a smaller variety of houses. While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the devices and methods utilized by duct-cleaning companies have altered considering that these research studies were carried out, the air ducts in houses have not.<p>
<p>The capability to add associated services is one advantage of being a roll-up company. Last year, Goettl acquired Dutton Pipes in California to expand its offerings. Pueblo Mechanical, an Arizona-based consolidator moneyed by Huron Capital, recently included Niemeyer Brothers Pipes Inc. Huron purchases many fields, ranging from automobile services to fire security, and it takes a systematic approach before going into a business. Furthermore, Pueblo is an example of Huron Capital's ExecFactor Â® technique, where it recognizes a particular sector and partners with a knowledgeable CEO to execute a buy-and-build thesis.<p>
