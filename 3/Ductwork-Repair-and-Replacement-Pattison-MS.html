<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
