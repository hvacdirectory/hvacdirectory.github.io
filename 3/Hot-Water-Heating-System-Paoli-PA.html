<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
