<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
