<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control.

Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again.
