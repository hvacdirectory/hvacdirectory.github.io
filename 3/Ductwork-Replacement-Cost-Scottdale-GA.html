Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
