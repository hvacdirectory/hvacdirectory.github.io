<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
