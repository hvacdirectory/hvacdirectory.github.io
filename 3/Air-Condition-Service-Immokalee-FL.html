<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
