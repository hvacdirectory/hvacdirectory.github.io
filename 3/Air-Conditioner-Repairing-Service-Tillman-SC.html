<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to set up, especially in an older home. Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be loud and trigger issues if you're highly allergic to dust. Additionally, particular fuels and equipment may need special licenses, and there is minimal versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the home.<p>
