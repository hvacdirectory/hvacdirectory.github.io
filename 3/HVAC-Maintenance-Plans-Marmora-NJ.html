These estimations take into consideration things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
