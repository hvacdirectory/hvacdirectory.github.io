<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>The EPA advises that you have your duct checked by a professional heating and cooling contractor.
