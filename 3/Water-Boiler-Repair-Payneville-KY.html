<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outside settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same duration. Generally, SEER supplies more information based on how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>Heaters are like vehicles. As they age, you can change one part only require another part replaced or fixed next year. It does not take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you needed to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
