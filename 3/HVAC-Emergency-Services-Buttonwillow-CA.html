<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
