<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the price great however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>How to Keep Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Banning CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
