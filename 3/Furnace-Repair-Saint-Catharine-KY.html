Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are often utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>Immediate effects might appear after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is merely removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
