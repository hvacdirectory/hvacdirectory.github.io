<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
