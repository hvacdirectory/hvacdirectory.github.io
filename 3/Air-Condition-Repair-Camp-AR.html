<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years.
