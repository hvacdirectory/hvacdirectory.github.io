<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
