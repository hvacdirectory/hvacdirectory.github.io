<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the amount (and often quality) of outdoor air that need to be continually supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation coupled with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
