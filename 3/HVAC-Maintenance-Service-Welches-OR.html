<p>Sean was very useful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
