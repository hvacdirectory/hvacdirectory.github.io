<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Manchester CA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
