<h3>HVAC Maintenance Plans in Strausstown PA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's probably your issue. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires changing. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
