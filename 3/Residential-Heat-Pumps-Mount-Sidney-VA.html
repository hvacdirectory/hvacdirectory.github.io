<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
