<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
