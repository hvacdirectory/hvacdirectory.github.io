<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the problem area in looking over the costs. He resolved the concern in one day, had actually changed the costs to what I thought about fair before he recalled, understood what may have caused the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not occur once again. I have considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
