<p>Specific instant results are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically difficult to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is essential to pay attention to the time and location the symptoms happen.

"Humidifier fever" is a typical illness brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are animals and home plants.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
