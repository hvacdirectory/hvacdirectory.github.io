<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here).

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really valuable in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.

The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
