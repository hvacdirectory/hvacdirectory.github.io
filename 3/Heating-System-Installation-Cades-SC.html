<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged.

We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center..

It was an enjoyment dealing with such a professional company and would highly suggest them to anybody trying to find HVAC.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, many Seattleites must discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a terrible, terrible summer.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of when a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
