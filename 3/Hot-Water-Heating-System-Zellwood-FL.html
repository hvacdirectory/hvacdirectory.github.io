<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider.
