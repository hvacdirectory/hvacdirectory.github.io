<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>First, understand that a bulk of your central air and system cost will come from the system itself. AC system costs start at $2,000 and can actually exceed $10,000 for larger houses. As you saw just recently, you require an appropriately-sized system for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down sooner than expected or your month-to-month energy expenses will increase. Therefore, you do not have total control regarding your AC system product expenses.<p>
