<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.

<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for bids. While both were helpful and practical, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located methods we could have more even heat.
