<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
