<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
