<p>A matched system is the combination of items that comprise your HVAC system. Depending on your region, a matched system can be made up of the following: an air conditioning unit and furnace, a heatpump and furnace, a heatpump and air handler, an air conditioner and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
