Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>

<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
