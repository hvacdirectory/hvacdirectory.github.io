<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
