<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
