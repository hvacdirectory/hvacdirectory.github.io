Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the essential electrical enhancements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time.

I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
