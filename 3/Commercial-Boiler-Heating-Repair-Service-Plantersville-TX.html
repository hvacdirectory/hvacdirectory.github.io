<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

<p>For example, issues occur when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outside air.

Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
