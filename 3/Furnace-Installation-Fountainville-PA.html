<p>A matched system is the mix of products that make up your HVAC system. Depending upon your area, a matched system can be made up of the following: an a/c and furnace, a heat pump and furnace, a heatpump and air handler, an air conditioning system and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system. By integrating elements that are made to work flawlessly together, you can develop a more effective perfect system.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you install, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your house won't be heated up effectively and the system will need to continuously run to attempt to heat the whole house, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Think about buying an energy-efficient model if your air conditioner is old. Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central units have to do with 15% more effective than standard models. New residential central air conditioner standards entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency requirements for central air conditioning conditioners for details, and consider buying a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher cost savings.<p>
