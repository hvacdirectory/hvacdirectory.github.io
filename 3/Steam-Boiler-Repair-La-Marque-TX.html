Temperature levels should range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air flow need to be avoided. Maintenance of correct temperatures and humidity levels and proper air flow will help to reduce the occurrence of upper breathing signs, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be effectively identified or remedied without a detailed building examination.

In many cases, these questions may quickly discover the problem and on-site visits are unneeded.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%.

To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
