<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Shepherdsville KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
