<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>The majority of credible HVAC service technicians will provide complimentary estimates with an in-person service call. Be careful of HVAC contractors who attempt to give you a free quote over the phone, as it may not properly reflect what they will discover when they have a look at the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost estimate, that amount will normally be applied toward your balance due, should you choose to work with that contractor.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's development does not always equate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The air, ventilation and heating conditioning organisation tends to run hot and cold. When consumers need their HVAC systems repaired for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition gets here, demand heats up throughout the summertime and winter season.<p>
