<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to evaluate circumstance & decided to go with them for the work.

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and efficiency if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
