<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
