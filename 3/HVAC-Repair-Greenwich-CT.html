<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Company in Greenwich</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
