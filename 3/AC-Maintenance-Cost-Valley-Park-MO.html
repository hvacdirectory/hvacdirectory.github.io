<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Only a professional can properly detect why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears strange or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call a professional. Similarly, if the procedure doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you need to do it regularly, it's probably time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
