<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air may likewise be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to represent a boost in the variety of workers in the area.<p>
<p>Because these activities generate large amounts of lead dust, people have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or real estate department for tips on which private laboratories or public companies might have the ability to help test your home for lead in paint. House test kits can not identify small amounts of lead under some conditions. Hire an individual with unique training for remedying lead paint issues to get rid of lead-based paint. Occupants, specifically kids and pregnant ladies, need to leave the building till all work is ended up and clean-up is done.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor begins but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it does not, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
