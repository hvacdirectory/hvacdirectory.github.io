<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Stone Park IL</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
