<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. But a lot of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same period. Generally, SEER provides more data based on how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain due to the fact that they only partly remove the radon decay products and do not decrease the amount of radon getting in the house. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trustworthy ways of lowering the health threat from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further information on air-cleaning devices to minimize indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very useful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
