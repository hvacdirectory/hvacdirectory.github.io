We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future.
