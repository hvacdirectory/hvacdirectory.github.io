And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes.
