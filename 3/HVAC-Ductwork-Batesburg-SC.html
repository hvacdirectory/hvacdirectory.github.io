<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Batesburg SC</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part.

<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
