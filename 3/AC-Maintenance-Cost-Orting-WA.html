These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
