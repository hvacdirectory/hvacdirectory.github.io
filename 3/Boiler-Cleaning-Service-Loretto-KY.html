<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>

Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a vicious, vicious summertime.<p>

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months before the current one ended.
