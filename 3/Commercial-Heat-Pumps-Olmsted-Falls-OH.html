<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal convenience inside.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively.
