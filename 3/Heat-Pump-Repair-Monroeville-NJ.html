<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Monroeville NJ</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
