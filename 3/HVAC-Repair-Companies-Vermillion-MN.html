<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the skills or tools necessary to examine refrigerant levels.
