<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
