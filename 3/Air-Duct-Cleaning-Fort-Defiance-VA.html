<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
