<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Important Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean considerable cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
