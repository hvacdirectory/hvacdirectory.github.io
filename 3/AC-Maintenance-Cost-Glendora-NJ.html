<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
