<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the increase it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the opportunities are good that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
