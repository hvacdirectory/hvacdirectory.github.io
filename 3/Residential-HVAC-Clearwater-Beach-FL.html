We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system prior to you buy.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
