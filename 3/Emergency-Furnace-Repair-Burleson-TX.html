<p>The world's leading all-in-one software application for commercial and residential HVAC organisations. HVAC technicians go through a number of possibly dangerous conditions.

<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results via a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>

<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may discover musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
