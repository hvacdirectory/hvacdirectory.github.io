<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden seem higher than regular, it is most likely time to think about a brand-new system.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
