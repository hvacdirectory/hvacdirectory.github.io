<h3>Heating Installation in Burlingame CA</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Around The Clock Air Conditioning is as assured: available immediately to provide exceptional service. Ilan Cohavi, the owner, works neatly and effectively to provide a completed task in record time. He set up 3 Nest Learning Thermostats in my home. His understanding of the product was excellent. His craftsmanship was outstanding and he didn't leave a mess. The bonus offer: he is a really enjoyable individual to deal with, and is very excited to complete the work as per the specs of his client. I would extremely recommend him for all your HVAC requires.<p>

According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems generally attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely efficient gas furnaces can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they concern perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months prior to the present one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
