<p>Power Vac America supplies commercial, commercial, institutional, residential and marine duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The crucial portion of your cooling is the outdoor system.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
