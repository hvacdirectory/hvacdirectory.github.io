The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
