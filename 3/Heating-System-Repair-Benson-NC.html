<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Benson NC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
