<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
