<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Heavy production industries use a fairly little portion of air conditioning service technicians and other HVAC workers, but pay some of the industry's highest incomes. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with an average wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 annually. Auto parts producers, aerospace producers and auto manufacturers are all within a few cents of each other at approximately $31 per hour, or over $64,000 each year. Railways are another high-wage employer, at an average of $29.33 per hour or $61,000 each year.<p>
