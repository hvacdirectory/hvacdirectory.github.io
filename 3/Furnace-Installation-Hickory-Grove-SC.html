<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
