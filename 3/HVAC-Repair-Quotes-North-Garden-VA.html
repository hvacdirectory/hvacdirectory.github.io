<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in North Garden</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center. However many of the things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a very common repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensor replaced as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
