<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
