<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
