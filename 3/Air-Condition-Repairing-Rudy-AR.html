<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they concern carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
