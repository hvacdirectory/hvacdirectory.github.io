<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
