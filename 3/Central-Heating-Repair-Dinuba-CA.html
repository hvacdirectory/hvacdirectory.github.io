<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
