<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
