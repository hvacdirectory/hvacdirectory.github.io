<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Oak Park CA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas furnaces While oil is generally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the two types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
