Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
