Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
