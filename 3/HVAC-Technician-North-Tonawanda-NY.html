DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
