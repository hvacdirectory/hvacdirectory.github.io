<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
