<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
