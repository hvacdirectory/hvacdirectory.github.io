<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
