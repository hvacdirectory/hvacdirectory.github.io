<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an abnormally high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.

I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
