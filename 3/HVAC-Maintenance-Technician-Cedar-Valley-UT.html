<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
