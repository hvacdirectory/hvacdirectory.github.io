<p>I admit I haven't done the math recently, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>

<p>Oil furnaces are normally not very effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not achieve a performance greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well because a drain requires to be set up.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off.
