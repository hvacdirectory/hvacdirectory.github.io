<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Wallisville TX</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
