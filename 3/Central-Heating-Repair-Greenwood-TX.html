<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a toxin depends on specific sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your house might not have enough ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or foul-smelling air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To identify odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can often be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this information may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
