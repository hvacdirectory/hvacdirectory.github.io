<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Mill Valley CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Mill Valley CA</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess situation & decided to go with them for the work. I enjoy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were very expert, courteous and the work was very effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
