<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace includes checking the advised connections as well as temperature and pressure determines. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and protected.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
