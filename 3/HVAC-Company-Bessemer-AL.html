<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the problem location in looking over the expense. He fixed the problem in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I thought about reasonable before he called back, understood what might have caused the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not happen again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
