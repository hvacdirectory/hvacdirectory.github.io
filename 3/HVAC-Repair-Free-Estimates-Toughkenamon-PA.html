This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
