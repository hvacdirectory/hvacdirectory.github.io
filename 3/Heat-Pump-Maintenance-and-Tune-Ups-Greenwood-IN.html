<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
