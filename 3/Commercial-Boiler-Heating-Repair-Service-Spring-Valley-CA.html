<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
