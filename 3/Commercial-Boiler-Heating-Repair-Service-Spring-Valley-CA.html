<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might invest more cash on cooling costs in the long run due to the fact that of the lower energy performance.<p>
