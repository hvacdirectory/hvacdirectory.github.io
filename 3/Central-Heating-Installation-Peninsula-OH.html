<p>Even if you don't feel unclean, pollen hold on to your hair and clothing where it can easily aggravate your nose and eyes, and add to indoor air pollution. Do not have time for a quick rinse? At least clean your hands to eliminate lingering pollen, particularly before making contact with food or your face, suggests the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Try these techniques to pollen-proof your life, specifically during allergic reaction season.<p>
<p>Individuals who dislike these contaminants must use allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid room furnishings that collect dust, specifically if they can not be cleaned in hot water. Since vacuuming can in fact increase airborne levels of mite allergens and other biological impurities, allergic individuals should also leave the home while it is being vacuumed. Utilizing central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high performance filters may likewise be of aid.<p>
