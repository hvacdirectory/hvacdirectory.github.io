The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
