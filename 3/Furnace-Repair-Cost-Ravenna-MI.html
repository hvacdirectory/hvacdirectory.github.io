If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m really fussy with my things. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.

Am happy I got this though because it has restored my faith in good production. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Provider I got given that I purchased it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s simply best.<p>
