<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Boca Raton FL</h3>
<p>Even more recent heating systems less than 5 years old have actually been found as bad. Too many house owners are stunned to find out that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. In some cases it is due to poor furnace design, however in a lot of cases, it's from overlook. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Examination of your furnace includes a System Analysis, which checks for particles on the burners, poor airflow, and a filthy filter or blower, with cleaning and adjusting of the above as required. The Performance Check-Up (see previous answer above) is likewise important to your furnace's life span.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
