<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Heavener OK</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, since it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
