<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
