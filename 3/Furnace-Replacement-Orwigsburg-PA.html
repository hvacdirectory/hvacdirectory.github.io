<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical features of environmentally friendly houses as part of the growing green building movement. Green jobs represented 20 percent of all newly constructed homes in the U.S. last year. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article predicted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire housing market.<p>

Wood-burning heat systems may not be excellent for the environment regardless of being carbon neutral since of the amount of wood needed to properly heat your whole house.<p>

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
