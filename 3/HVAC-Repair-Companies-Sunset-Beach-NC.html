In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
