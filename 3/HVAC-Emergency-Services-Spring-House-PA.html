<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works however your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
