<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.

Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
