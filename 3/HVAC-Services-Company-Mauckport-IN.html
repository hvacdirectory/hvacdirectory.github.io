<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
