<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is generally used in a third-floor or 2nd location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put.
