<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
