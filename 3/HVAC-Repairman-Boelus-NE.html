<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
