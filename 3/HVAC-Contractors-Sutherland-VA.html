<h3>Home Air Conditioning Service in Sutherland VA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heat pumps normally require excavation to set up, which adds numerous thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
