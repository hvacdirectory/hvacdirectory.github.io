<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>

There are a range of humidifier alternatives that will help keep constant humidity levels and produce comfortable living conditions in your house.<p>
