<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
