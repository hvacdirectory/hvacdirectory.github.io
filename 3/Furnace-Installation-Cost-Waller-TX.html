<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
