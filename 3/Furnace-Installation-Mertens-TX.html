<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work.

<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
