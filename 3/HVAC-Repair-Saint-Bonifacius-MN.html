<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Saint Bonifacius MN</h3>
<p>Provider's Healthy Structures Program offers a broadened suite of advanced options to help provide healthier, more secure, more effective and efficient indoor environments across essential verticals including commercial offices, health care, education, hospitality, and retail.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
