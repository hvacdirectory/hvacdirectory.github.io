<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons.

According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest typical salaries for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where moisture levels are usually greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
