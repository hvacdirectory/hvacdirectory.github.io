<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may observe musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your physician about them. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
