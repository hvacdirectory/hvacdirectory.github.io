<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
