<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
