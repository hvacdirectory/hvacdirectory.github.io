<p>The function of most structure ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at sensible energy costs. Load computing is described as the Manual J estimation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to determining the size of a system required based upon BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of unit for your house also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for distributing cold and hot air throughout your home, providing a comfy climate in every room. However ducts that are not installed correctly or maintained can disperse pollutants from one space to another. With time, dust, dander and even mold can build up in your ducts, lowering the general air quality. Employ a professional to ensure your ducts are circulating fresh, tidy air.<p>

Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does provide guidelines about the most common IAQ office grievances.<p>
