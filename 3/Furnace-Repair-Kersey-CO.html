<p>Customer items that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals.

<p>Martin stated the company is all set to put down roots" in the Tri-Cities and expects to have a team of about 7 to 10 staff members when it opens the doors on the new facility by early fall.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
