<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
