<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
