Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils.

It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
