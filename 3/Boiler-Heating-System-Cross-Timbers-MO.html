<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
