<p>Buildings are developed or intended to respond actively to a few of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and maintain surface areas to improve their durability, appearance, or efficiency. In other cases, such modifications subtly and even dramatically modify structures in ways that might be very important to their own integrity or their influence on building occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We might find it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, particularly, some of the methods used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to get a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Airborne irritants are simply a reality of life. Molds can cause flare-ups of allergic reaction symptoms, and sometimes, trigger asthma attacks. Bacteria, bacteria, and viruses likewise can live in the air you breathe every day. These air-borne pollutants can impact your home convenience devices, too.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
