<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a couple of years back.<p>
