In other cases, such modifications discreetly and even significantly alter structures in ways that might be important to their own integrity or their influence on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We might discover it beneficial to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the methods utilized by researchers studying ecosystems, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
