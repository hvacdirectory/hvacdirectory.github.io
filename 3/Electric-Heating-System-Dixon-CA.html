<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
