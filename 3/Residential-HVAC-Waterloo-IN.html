<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
