<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Glenoma WA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in house building is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in roofs, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the home.<p>

No additional charge.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
