<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Often times, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best choice for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
