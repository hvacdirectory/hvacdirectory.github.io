<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Fort Collins CO</h3>
<p>Particular immediate results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often hard to identify if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is necessary to take note of the time and location signs occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the area, for example, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
