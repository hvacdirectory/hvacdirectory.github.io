They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My partner said that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have met in a long time. If we want to have options to ACME heating, we require to support the genuine individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>
