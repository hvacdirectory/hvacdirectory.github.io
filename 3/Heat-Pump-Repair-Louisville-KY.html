<p>Consumer items that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive eliminators, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to trigger cancer in animals.

Usage products that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use inside just if the location is well ventilated.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your doctor about them.
