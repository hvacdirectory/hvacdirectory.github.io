<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building products contribute to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic substances) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
