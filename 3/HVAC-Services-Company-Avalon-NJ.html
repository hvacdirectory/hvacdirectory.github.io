Soil by highways and roads may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Usage door mats to clean your feet prior to entering the home. Change your clothes before you go house and wash these clothes separately if you work with lead in your task or a pastime.
