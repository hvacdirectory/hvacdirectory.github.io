<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
