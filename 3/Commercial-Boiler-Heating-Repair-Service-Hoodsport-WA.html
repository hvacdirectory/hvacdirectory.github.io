<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank.

<p>Seattle heating systems can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the typical temperature levels in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years. Your heating unit will work hard for you, but like your vehicle, doing regular and routine maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid issues, and keep your guarantee intact.<p>

Since they're low-cost, an ethical company does not make use of cheap labor opportunities simply. Affordable craftsmanship is generally inferior craftsmanship, and it never assists a company build long-term relationships with customers.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years back and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Since it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you know it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild impacts that are frequently incorrect for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, nausea and disorientation. The effects of CO direct exposure can vary greatly from individual to person depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
