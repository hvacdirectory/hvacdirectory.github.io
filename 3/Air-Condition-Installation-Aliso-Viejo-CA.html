Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
