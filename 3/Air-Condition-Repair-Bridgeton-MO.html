<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
