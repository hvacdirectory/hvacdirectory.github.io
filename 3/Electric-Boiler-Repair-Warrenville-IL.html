<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
