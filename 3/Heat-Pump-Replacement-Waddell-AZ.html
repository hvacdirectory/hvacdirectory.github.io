<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
