<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Fairfax VA</h3>
<p>New air conditioners normally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER rating means higher energy efficiency and possibly lower energy costs. An excellent SEER score for you depends upon your home size, where you live and other elements. Even the minimally enabled SEER rating is going to be far more energy efficient than your current, old a/c unit. It's not always about selecting the model with the highest SEER score, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>
<p>Picking the best size a/c is an essential part of the HVAC purchasing process and one that you'll need an HVAC professional to help you with.

And if it's too small, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>

Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air escapes the system.<p>
