<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was type of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
