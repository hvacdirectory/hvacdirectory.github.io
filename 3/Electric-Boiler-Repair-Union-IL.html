<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial rate of a system competitive with standard devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new construction (houses usually use between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, brand-new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>
