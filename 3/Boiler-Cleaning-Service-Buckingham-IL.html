<p>Even if you don't feel filthy, pollen clings to your hair and clothes where it can quickly irritate your nose and eyes, and add to indoor air pollution. Do not have time for a quick rinse?

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
