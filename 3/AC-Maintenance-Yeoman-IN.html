<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, given that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>The main reason homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services used. If the system is new and still under a maker's service warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any major repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. Nevertheless, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
