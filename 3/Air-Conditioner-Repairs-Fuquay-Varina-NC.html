The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

I very extremely suggest the two gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service. If the present system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and remedied, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
