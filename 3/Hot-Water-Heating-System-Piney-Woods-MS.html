<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
