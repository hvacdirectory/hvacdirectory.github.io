<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Braidwood IL</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
