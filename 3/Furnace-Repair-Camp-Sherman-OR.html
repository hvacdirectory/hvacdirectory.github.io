<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
