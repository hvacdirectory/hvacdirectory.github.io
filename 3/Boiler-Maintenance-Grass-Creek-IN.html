<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do decide to provide auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
