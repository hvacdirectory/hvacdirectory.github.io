We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than room a/c unit. In addition, they are out of the way, peaceful, and practical to run.

In an average air-conditioned home, air conditioning takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, triggering power plants to emit about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed.
