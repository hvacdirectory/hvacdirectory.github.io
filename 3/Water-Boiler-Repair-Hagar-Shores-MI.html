According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than room a/c unit. In addition, they are out of the way, peaceful, and practical to run.
