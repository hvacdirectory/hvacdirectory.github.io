<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
