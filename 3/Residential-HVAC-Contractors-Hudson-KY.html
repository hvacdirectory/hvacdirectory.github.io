<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
