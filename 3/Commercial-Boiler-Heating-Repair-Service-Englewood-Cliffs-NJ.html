<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Englewood Cliffs NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
