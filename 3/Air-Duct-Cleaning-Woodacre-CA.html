<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
