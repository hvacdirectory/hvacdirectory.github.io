Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
