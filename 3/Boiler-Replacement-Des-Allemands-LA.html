<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Des Allemands LA Home</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in home building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, roofings, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists tire them from the house.<p>
