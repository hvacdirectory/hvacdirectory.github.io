<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
