<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
