<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate substantial savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>For instance, problems arise when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate sufficient amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or positioned in such a method that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Improperly situated outside air intake vents can also generate air polluted with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
