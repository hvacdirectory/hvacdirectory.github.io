<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
