<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
