<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
