<p>Considering that the 1980s, producers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues.

There are a number of methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
