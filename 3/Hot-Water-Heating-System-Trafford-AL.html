<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Trafford AL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
