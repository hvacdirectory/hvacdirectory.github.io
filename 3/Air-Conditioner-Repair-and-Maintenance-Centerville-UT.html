A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not be able to offer enough heat to keep your house comfy.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heater. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
