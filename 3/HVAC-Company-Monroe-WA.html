<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying simply a cooling system.
