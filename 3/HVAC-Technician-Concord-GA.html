<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Concord GA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
