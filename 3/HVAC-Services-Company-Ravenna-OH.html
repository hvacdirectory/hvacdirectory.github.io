<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned up. Whether or not this is the reason for the problem, it's a good early treatment to attempt. Plan to do this on a fairly warm day. Never utilize a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins.

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
