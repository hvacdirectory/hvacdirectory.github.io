<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
