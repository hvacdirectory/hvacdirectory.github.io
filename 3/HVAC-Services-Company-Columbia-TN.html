<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
