<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to understand and keep.<p>
