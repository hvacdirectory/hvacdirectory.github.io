<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a Bowman SC HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to determine surrogate for indoor toxins given off by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>

<h3>Solar Heating System in Bowman SC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.

Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
