<h3>Things to Look for When Hiring an Roanoke VA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
