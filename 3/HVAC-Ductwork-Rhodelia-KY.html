<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were practical and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a much better deal, for extraordinary service. Rather than an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heater and situated methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but significant adjustments in his bid. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump since of recent warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
