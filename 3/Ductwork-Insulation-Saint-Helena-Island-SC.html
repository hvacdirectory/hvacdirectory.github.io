<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Saint Helena Island SC</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
