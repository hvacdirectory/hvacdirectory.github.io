<p>We take a look at hints before we offer suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
