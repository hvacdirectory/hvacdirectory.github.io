<p>First, unlike central air, you have a couple of options when it pertains to central heating systems. We'll jump into expenses later, but you can pick from a boiler, furnace or heat  pump. In general, heating systems are the most budget friendly alternative. Nevertheless, your choice will mainly boil down to what your ducts allow or what was formerly in your home. Ask your heating contractor for the most proper option.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
