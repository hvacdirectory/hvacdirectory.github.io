<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
