<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Point Arena CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
