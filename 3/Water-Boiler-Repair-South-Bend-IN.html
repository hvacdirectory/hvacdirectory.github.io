<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I have actually got a bud who works in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used around the globe, including EMV. He's said a number of times that the unique code feature is optional and numerous, numerous merchants do not utilize it because it slows down transactions much more due to the back-and-forth communications needed. I don't understand enough about the innovation to know if that is even possible.<p>
