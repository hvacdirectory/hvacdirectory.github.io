<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate.
