<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if needed, update the building envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>
<p>The capability of natural chemicals to cause health results differs significantly, from those that are highly poisonous, to those without any known health result.

At present, very little is learnt about what health effects happen from the levels of organics usually found in homes. Many natural substances are understood to trigger cancer in animals; some are believed of triggering, or are known to trigger, cancer in people.<p>
