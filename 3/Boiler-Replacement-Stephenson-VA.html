Because it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow constraint will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
