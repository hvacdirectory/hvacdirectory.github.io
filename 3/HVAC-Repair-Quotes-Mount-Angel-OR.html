The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outdoor system.

Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
