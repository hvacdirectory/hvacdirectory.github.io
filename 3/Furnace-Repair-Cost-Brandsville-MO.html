Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
