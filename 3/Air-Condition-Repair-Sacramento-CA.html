<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Numerous typical structure products used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Because the fibers can be spread into the air during the elimination process, elimination of asbestos-containing products is not constantly optimum. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is often suggested instead.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
