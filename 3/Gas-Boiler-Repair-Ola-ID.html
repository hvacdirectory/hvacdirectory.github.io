My partner stated that she had actually seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good individuals I have satisfied in a long period of time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
