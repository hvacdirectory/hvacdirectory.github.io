<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, many of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
