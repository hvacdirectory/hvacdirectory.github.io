<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Tempe AZ Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My wife stated that she had actually seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good people I have met in a very long time.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
