<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
