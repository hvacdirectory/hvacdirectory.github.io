<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy.

In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
