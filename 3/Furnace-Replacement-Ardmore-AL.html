In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
