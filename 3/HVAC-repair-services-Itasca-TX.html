<p>My eldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
