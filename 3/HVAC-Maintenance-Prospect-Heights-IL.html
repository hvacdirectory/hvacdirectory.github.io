<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing integrates quality products and exceptional service with development and technological advances to provide high-performance cooling and heating items worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external unit.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future.
