<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
