<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to supply enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
