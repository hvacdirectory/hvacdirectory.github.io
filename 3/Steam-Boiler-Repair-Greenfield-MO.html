<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
