<p>Self-installation tends to produce more issues than it resolves. In fact, it frequently prompts expert intervention anyhow to fix some of the issues that were developed throughout the installation.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
