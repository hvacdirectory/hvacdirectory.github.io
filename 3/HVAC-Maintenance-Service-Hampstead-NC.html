Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
