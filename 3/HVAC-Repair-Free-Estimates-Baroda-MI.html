<p>Generally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
