<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work.

For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an abnormally high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the trouble location in looking over the expense. He solved the concern in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I considered fair prior to he called back, understood what may have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not happen again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
