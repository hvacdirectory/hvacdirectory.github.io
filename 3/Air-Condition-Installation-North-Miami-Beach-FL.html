<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
