<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the best temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Only be concerned if your house is not warming up. However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you must contact a specialist to check and repair the unit.<p>

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
