<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
