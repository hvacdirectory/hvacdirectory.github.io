In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>

During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps should also be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents should be alert to the introduction of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures should not be carried out till these problems have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>5. Odor good naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney scent with a clean cooking area or clean synthetic scents in laundry items and air fresheners emit lots of different chemicals into the air. You won't discover their names on the item labels.

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically important to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer.

Evaluation of this information might recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
