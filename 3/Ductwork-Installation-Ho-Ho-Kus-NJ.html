<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the house.

<h3>Finding Greatest HVAC Contractors in Ho Ho Kus NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
