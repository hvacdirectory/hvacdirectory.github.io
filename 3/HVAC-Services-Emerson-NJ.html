<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of reducing direct exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will reduce but not remove exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Since smoking produces such large amounts of toxins, mechanical or natural ventilation methods do not remove them from the air in your house as quickly as they develop. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it requires to substantially minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. Consequently, the most effective method to reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
