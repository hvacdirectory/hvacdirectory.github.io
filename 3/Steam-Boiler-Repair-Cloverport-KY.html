<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Ideal Furnace Repair at Cloverport KY</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
