<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
