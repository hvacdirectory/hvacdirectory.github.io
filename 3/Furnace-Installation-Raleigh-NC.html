<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
