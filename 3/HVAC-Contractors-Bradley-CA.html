<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
