<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by a lot of public water supplies, it has actually been discovered in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your house and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, call a laboratory accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
