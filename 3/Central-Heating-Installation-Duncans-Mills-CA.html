<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
