<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, as opposed to commercial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to individual areas.<p>

Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps usually last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement might be the most affordable option.<p>
