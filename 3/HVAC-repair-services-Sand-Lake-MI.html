<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat.

<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
