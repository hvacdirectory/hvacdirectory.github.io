<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
