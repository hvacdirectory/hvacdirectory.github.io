<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no impurity sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air might also be a problem when ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of infected soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
