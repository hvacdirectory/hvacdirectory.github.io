<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
