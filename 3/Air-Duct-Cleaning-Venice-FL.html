Ilan always makes himself offered - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these devices).

<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in covert or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
