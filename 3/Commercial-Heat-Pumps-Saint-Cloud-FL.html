<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Service! Environment Pro is trusted and really cared about us and our scenario. We got home one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might try to find and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right before a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>
