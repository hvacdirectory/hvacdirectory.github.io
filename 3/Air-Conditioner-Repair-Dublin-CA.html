<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works however the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, considering that it is secured indoors. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak to your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 must not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electricity. The two operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
