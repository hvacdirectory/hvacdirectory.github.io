Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it significantly challenging for your lungs to function properly, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Both should be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
