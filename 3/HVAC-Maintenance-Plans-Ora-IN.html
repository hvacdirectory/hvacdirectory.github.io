<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
