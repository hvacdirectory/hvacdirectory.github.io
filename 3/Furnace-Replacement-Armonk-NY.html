<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
