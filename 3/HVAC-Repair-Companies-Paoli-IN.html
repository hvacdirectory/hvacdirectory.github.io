<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
