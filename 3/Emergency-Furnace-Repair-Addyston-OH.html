<h3>Truth All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Addyston OH</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We picked getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Many aspects impact IAQ. These factors consist of poor ventilation (absence of outside air), issues managing temperature level, high or low humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering the building. In some cases, specific pollutants like dust from building or renovation, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals released as a gas gradually) might trigger bad IAQ.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.
