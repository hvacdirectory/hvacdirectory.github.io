The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
