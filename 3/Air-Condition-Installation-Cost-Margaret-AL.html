<p>Geothermal heatpump, as well as all other types of heat pumps, have actually effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a scientific way of determining how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. Many geothermal heatpump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
