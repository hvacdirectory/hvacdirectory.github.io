<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Furnace in North Houston TX</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
