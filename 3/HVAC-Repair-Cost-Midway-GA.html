<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
