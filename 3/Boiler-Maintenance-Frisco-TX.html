<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at sensible energy costs. Your furnace has many parts that can impact the health and safety of you and your loved ones. Having a total check of your furnace will offer assurance that it is safe to run. Paragon Heating & Home Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Examination of your furnace includes a Health & Security Analysis, which checks the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide gas leaks and infected breathing air), checks the pilot safety (surge risk), checks the high limit (fire danger) and includes a visual assessment for other dangers. In reality, our Safety Assessment includes ten separate security checks of your system.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources.
