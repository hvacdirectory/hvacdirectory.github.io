<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Orem UT</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a variety of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized building products, furnishings, and mold as major issues, but much of the risk likewise originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might notice undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your physician about them. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
