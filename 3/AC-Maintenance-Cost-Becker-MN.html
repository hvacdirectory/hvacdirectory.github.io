The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can vary substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job may require completely various steps and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being inspected.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can become blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.

By contrast, examining and replacing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, typically without any tools required.
