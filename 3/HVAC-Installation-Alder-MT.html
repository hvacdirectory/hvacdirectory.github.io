<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling.

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
