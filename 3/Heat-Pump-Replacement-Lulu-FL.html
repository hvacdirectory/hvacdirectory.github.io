<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
