In other cases, such modifications subtly or even dramatically change buildings in ways that might be essential to their own stability or their effect on building occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time. We might find it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the techniques utilized by scientists studying environments, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
