<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Streetsboro OH</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their performance gradually. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
