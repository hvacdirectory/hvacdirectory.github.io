<p>Ask about training and accreditations. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one element (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
