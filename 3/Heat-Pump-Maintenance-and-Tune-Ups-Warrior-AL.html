<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating.

Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been revealed to reduce levels of some chemicals in lab experiments.

Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because extremely damp soil may promote the development of microorganisms which can affect allergic people.<p>
