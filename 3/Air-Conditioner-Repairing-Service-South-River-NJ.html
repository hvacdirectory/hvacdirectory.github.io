<h3>Blocked Vents Repair in South River NJ</h3>
<p>If your ac system is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple issue like particles blocking the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to examine not just the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home.
