<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
