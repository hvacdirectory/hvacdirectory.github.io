<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
