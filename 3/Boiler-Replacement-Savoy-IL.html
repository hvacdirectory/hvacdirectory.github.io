<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same.

Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
