<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
