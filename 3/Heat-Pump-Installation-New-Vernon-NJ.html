<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each room in your house, and if it establishes fractures which leak, they need to be fixed. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse outcomes. Your home will not be properly cooled, and your energy expenses will go up.
