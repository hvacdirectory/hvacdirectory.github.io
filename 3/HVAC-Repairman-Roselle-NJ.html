<p>Normally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area.
