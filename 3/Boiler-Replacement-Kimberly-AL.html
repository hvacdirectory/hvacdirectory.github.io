However, you'll save cash over the long term since of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source systems. The lack of moving parts indicates you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're substantially more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
