<p>Stability Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heaters can heat your house. Truthfully, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
