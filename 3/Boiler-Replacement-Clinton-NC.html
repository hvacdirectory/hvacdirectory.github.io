<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
