<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
