<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Smithville OK</h3>
<p>A split cooling system might cost near that of a standard HVAC system but has shown to be an alternative cost effective alternative to homes that do not have ductwork. Utilized along with other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window ac system, space heaters, or oil heating units, it can boost the comfort of your house while keeping your monthly utility costs affordable.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
