<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
