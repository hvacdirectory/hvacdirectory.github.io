<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was type of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<p>Similar to most house improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heater can vary widely based on the size of the house. Many furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
