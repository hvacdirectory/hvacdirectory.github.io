<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of 30 days throughout which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees.

When the heat gets excruciating, a central air conditioning system in your house suggests you have the power to change the temperature to a constant temperature level.<p>
