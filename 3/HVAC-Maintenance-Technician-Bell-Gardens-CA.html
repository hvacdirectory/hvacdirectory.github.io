<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from items or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
