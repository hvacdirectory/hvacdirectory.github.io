<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
