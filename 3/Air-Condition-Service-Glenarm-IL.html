<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Glenarm IL</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
