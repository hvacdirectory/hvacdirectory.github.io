Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
