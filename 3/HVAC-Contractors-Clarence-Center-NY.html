<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Clarence Center NY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
