<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
