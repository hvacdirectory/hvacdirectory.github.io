<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in San Jose CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
