Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
