<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>A customized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the exact same air path. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the space because its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really heated, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
