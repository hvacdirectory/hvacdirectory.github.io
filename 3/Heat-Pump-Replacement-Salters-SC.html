Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater.
