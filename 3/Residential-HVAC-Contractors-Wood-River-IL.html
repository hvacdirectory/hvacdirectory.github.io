<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the skills or tools required to check refrigerant levels.
