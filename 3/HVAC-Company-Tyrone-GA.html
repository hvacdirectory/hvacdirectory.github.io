<p>Just like a lot of house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating unit can differ commonly based upon the size of the house.

A little house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
