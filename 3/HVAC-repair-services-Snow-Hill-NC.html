<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler typically occur. In many cases, the belt is improperly aligned or used and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
