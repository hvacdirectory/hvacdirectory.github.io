<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy.

<p>A third way to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
