After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
