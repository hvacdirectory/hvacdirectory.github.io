<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
