Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
