Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
