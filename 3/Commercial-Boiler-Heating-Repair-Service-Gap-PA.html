All the moist hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining pipes effectively. A restriction in your drain pipelines causes a water leak. There are various places a blockage can occur. One of the primary areas where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
