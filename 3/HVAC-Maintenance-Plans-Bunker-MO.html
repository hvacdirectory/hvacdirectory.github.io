Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
