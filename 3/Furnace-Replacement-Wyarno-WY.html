<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
