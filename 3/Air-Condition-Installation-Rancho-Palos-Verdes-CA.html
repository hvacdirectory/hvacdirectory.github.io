<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Rancho Palos Verdes CA</h3>

From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins streaming through your system.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
