<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
