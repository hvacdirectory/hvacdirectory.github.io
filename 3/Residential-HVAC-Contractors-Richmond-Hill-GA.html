<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>Heat Pump Installation in Richmond Hill GA</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is improperly gotten rid of from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can likewise arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including infected soil tracked within, and usage of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the assessment on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new home owner I have discovered how to determine the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<h3>What You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Richmond Hill GA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
