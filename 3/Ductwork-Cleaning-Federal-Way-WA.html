<p>If your a/c is more than eight years old, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's a simple issue like debris clogging the condenser system or a worn fan belt.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
