<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
