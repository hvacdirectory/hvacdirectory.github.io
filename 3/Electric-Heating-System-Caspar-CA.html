<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
