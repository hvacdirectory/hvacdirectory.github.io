<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
