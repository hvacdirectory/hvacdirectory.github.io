Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts.

As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that a project such as this is going to require a somewhat extensive amount of work it is recommended that a house owner request a number of estimates from a range of contractors.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems.
