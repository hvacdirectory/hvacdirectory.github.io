It's not always about selecting the design with the greatest SEER score, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as an automobile radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
