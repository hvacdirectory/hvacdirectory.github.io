<h3>Solar Heating System in Hiram OH</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
