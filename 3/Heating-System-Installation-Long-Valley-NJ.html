<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Long Valley NJ Home Owners</h3>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
