<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board need to be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
