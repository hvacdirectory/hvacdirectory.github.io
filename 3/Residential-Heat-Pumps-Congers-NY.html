<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Congers NY</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as different as the different homes they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condos, row housing, and so on). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), proper filtering, and humidity manage all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is running securely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
