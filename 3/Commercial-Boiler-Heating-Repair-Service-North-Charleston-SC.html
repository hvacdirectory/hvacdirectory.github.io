Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
