<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
