<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
