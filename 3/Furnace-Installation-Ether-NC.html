The most reliable fans are resilient and quiet. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors.

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
