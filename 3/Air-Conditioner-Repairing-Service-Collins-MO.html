<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the skills or tools needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
