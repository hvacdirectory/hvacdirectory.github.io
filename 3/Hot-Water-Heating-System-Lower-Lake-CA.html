<p>. Before picking the installation place of air conditioner, a number of main aspects need to be considered. Firstly, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units ought to not fall on the location of rest or work area. Secondly, there need to not be any obstacles en route of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible. The outside system needs to also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully released outdoors and the performance of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly a good idea to set up the a/c unit units in easily accessible locations, for further maintenance during operation.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
