<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Poquoson VA?</h3>
<p>Many people do not understand how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier.
