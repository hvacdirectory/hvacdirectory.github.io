<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if essential, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
