<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
