<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period. Generally, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
