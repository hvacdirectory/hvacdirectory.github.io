<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types.

Work environment temperatures ought to be preserved in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air circulation should be avoided.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal elements as well.
