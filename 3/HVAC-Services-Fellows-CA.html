<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family home installation company completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
