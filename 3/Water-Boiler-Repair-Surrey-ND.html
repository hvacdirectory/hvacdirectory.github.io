<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
