<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your house may not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To discover odors in your home, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Often a temporary indoor air quality issue is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more intricate issues-- determined by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, among the three strategies below might be suitable.<p>
