They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable.
