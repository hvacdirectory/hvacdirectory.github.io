<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
