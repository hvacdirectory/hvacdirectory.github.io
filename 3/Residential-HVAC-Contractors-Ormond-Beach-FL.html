<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
