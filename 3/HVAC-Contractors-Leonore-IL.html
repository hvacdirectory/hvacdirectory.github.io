<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually triggered by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in majority the work environment indoor air examinations it has conducted.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
