<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
