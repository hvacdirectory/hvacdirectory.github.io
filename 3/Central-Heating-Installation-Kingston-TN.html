Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room.

<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in leading condition for the a/c unit to work well.

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
