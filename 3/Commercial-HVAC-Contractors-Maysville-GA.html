Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center. But a number of the things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>It is then wise to vet the advised contractors by doing research and using a service like Modernize to immediately compare numerous quotes from the top HVAC contractors.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with your home. This company introduced a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the examination on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health threat reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a new resident I have discovered how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
