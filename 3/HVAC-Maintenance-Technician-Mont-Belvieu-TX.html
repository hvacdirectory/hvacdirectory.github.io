<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical energy, a heatpump is a cost-efficient service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the right temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel extremely hot. If your home is not heating up, only be worried. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you ought to hire an expert to repair the system and inspect.<p>
