Inadequate ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or put in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly situated outside air intake vents can also bring in air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.
