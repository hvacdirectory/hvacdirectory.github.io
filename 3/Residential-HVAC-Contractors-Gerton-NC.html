<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.
