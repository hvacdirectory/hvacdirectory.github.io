Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
