One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to withstand current, which then produces heat.<p>
