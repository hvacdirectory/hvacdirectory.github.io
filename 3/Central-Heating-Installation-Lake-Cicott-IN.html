<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors.
