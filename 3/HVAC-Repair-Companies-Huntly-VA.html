The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
