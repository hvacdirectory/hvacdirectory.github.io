<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>For instance, problems arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in appropriate quantities of outside air. Inadequate ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or placed in such a method that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Incorrectly located outside air intake vents can also bring in air polluted with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel.

You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
