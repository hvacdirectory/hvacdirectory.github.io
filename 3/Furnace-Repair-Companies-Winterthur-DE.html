Some sources, such as constructing materials, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release pollutants basically continuously. Other sources, related to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies release pollutants intermittently. Malfunctioning or unvented appliances or improperly used items can launch greater and often hazardous levels of toxins inside.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

If you currently have a home heating unit, you might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
