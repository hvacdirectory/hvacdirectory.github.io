<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
