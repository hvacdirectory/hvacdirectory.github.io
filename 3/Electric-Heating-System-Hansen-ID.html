<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate.

As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
