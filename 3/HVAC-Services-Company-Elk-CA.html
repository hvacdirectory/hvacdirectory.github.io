<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment at Elk CA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up evaluation results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source systems. The lack of moving parts means you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're substantially more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
