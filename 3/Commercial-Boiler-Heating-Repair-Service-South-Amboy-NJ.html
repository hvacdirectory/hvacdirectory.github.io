It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>

Follow the guidelines above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
