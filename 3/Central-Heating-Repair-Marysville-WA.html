<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
