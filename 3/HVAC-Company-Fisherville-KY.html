<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning system be? Too large and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning unit won't be able to cool the house correctly. When shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the elements that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to ignore any of them.<p>
