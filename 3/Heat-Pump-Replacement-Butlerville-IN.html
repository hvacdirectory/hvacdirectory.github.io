Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

In the past, a few of these homes had elevated levels of formaldehyde since of the large amount of high-emitting pressed wood products used in their construction and because of their fairly small interior space.<p>
