<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
