<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
