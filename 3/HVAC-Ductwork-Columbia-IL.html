<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the traditional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
