<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the house. Toxins could come from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and bacteria, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
