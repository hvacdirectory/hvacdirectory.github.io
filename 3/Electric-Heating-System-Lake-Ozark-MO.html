<p>To identify the proper size of oil furnace you need for your home, calculate the home's square video and identify what zone your home is in.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
