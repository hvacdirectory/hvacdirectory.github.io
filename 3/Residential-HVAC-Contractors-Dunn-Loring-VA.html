My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate.

Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been running issue free for the past 2+ years.
