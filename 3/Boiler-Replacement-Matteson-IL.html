<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
