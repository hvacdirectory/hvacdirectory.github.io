<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and workplaces matters, particularly considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
