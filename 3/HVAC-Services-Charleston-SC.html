<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. Since they just partly remove the radon decay items and do not decrease the quantity of radon getting in the house, the efficiency of these devices is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a dependable methods of lowering the health danger from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air contaminants.<p>
