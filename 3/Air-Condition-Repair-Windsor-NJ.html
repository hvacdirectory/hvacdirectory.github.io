<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
