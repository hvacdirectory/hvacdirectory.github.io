<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
