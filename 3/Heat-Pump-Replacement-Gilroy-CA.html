<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Gilroy CA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
