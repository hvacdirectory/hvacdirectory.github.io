<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
