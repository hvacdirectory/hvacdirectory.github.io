<p>In many cases, if products have stopped working to dry out numerous days after the suspected water occasion, mold growth is believed within wall cavities even if it is not immediately visible. Through a mold investigation, which may include destructive inspection, one need to have the ability to determine the presence or lack of mold. In a scenario where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality may have been jeopardized, mold removal might be needed.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
