<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Adamsville AL</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.
