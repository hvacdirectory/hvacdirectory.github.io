<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Cecilia KY?</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Initially, understand that a bulk of your central air conditioning and system cost will come from the unit itself. AC system costs start at $2,000 and can in fact go beyond $10,000 for larger houses. As you saw just recently, you require an appropriately-sized system for your house. Otherwise, the AC will break down faster than anticipated or your month-to-month energy expenses will increase. Therefore, you do not have total control as to your AC system material costs.<p>
