A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several rooms with one external system. In the outside system of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking several traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems found in the room.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
