PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
