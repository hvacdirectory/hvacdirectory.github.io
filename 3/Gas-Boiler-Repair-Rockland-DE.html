<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and homes matters, particularly considering that we invest most of our lives indoors. A/c unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations construct up inside your home.<p>
