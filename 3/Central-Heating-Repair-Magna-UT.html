Many common building products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
