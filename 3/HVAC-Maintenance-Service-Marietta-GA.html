Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
