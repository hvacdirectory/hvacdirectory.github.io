<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that best temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimal efficiency and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, creating a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also cause your energy expenses to rise. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your house. It will have to work more difficult and may get too hot if the system is too little. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
