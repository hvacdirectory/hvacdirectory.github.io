<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires handled by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
