<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in gathering info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
