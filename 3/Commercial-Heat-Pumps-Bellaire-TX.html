<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in gathering info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention.
