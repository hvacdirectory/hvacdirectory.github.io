<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
