<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource section suggests that "Air Filtering must have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to reduce the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can lower the efficiency of the coils.<p>

In a scenario where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality might have been jeopardized, mold removal might be needed. Mold screening and examinations ought to be carried out by an independent detective to prevent any dispute of interest and to insure accurate results; free mold testing provided by remediation companies is not suggested.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the basic indoor air quality satisfies a certain standard. Occupational exposure limitations noted in health and safety policies and the Limit Limit Values ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent illness or particular effects (like eye and nose inflammation) in commercial circumstances. These limitations might not be appropriate in office settings or for the home.<p>
