<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
