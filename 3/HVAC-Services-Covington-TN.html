<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, family pet hair and other debris cause issues like failure to provide adequate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you find the issue and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. Do It Yourself filter replacement options variety from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. If the technician concerns your house, that may be a very pricey dirty-filter diagnosis. This type of cleaning work ought to be carried out in a regular basis, so a furnace tune-up is needed, inspect our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
