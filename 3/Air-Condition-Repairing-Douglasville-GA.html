<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Douglasville GA</h3>
<p>Lots of commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also utilize natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air introduced into a space per an unit of time, and is frequently revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Air-Conditioning, heating and refrigerating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for appropriate air quality online.<p>

<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
