<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
