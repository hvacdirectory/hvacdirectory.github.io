<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
