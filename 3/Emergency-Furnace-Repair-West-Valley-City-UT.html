Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed house owners.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
