<p>We contacted Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to state that not just did we get the central air going however also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from starting to end were very professional, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>

If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the system is not running effectively.
