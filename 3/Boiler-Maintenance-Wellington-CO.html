Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in collecting info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention.
