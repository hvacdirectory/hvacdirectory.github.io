<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system.
