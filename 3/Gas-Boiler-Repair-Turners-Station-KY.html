<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Turners Station KY</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
