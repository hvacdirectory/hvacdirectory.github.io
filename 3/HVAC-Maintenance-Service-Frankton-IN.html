<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
