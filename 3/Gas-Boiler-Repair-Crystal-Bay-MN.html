<p>They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for.

<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
