<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the issue and repaired very quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>

For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
