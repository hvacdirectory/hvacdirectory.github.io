<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. First, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have actually maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are really experienced and professional. Costs are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
