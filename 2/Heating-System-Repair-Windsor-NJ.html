Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.
