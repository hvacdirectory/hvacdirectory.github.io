<p>We advise using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant might cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
