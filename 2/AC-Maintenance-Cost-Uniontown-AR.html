<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the ideal temperature level.
