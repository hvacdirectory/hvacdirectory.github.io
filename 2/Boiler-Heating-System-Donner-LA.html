<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
