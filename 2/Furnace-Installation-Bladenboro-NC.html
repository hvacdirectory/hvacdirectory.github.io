<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
