<p>Because the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more efficient. This was originally driven by increasing energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental problems.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
