He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
