<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the skills or tools needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large company in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract tries to upsell you whenever they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months prior to the current one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
