<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power should not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a really comfy temperature level.
