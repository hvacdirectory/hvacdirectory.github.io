Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
