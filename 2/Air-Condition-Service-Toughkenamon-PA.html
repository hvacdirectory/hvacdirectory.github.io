<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
