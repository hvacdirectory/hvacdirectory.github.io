<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
