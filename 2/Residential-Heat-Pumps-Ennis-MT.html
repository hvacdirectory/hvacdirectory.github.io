<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
