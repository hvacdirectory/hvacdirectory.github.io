Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them till they have actually been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
