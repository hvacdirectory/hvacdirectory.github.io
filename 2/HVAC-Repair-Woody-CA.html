<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<h3>Gas Central Heating in Woody CA</h3>
<p>The homes and composition of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.
