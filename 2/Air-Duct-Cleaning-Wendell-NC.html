<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures build up inside, direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.
