<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most inexpensive if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
