<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
