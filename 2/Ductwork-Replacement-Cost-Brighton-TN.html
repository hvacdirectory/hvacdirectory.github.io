If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c be? Too large and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioner will not be able to cool the house correctly. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the factors that you require to take into account.

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
