<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual occasions.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
