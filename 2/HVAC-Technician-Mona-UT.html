<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
