<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to replace or update your unit if it's five years of ages or older.

Extremely economical, and energy-efficient, and offering greater control over when and where the air enters your home, All Points Heating can assist you select the best ductless cooling system for your requirements.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make sure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
