In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps significantly change structures in ways that may be necessary to their own stability or their influence on building occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We might discover it helpful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, some of the techniques utilized by scientists studying communities, in order to gain a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
