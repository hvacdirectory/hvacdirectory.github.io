<h3>What You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Lockwood CA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
