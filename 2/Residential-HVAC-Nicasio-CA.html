<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
