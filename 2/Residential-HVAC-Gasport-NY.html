<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
