<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Covington TX Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The majority of people know that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can also have significant, damaging effect. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of toxins might be two to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution among the top 5 environmental health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
