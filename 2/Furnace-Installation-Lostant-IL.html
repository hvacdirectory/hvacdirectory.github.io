<p>We called Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & chose to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to state that not only did we get the central air going however also changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke with from starting to end were very expert, considerate and the work was really effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
