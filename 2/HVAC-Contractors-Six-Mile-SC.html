<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
