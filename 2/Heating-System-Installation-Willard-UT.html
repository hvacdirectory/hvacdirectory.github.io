<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
