<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
