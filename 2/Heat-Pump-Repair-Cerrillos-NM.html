<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them till they have actually been properly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They met my requirements entirely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
