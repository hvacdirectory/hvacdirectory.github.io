<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
