<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Hudson CO</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
