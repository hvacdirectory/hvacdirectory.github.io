<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
