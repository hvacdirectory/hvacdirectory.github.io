<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
