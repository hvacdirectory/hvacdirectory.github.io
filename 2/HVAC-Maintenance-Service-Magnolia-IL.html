Incorrectly located outside air intake vents can likewise bring in air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.

(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
