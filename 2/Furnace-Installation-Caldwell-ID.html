<p>Lots of commercial buildings use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also utilize natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outdoor air introduced into an area per an unit of time, and is often revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal elements as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple rooms at once, however are not very energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this may spend more cash on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, human beings exhale co2, which in little quantities is not harmful, but may become dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to collect. Micro-organisms or germs may also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the entire work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
