Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, merely including refrigerant is not a solution. A trained technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant.

No extra charge.<p>
