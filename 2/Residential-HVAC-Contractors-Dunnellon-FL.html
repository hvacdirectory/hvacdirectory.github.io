<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for several years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses suddenly seem greater than normal, it is most likely time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to mention the money you'll minimize repair expenses. If your heating system is 25 years of ages or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel expenses in half.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same period. Generally, SEER offers more data based on how the EER carries out in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
