<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
