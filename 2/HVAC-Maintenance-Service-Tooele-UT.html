<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
