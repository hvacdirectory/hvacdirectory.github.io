Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
