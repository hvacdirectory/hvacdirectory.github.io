<p>House owners might also assume that because a glowing flooring heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home enhancement, its installation will immediately raise their house's worth. No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively affects home values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Magazine.

<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
