<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else restricting the flow of air. Not just will blocked vents and registers affect your convenience, they can also lead to duct leakages due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
