<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
