<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
