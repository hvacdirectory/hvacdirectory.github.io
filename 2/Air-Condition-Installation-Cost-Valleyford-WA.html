<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
