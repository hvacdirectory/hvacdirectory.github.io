<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.

A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
