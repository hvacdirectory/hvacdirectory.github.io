<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
