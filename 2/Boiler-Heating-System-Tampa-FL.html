<p>Many home items launch natural vapors that can cause negative health effects. These results may include nose and throat irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, and nausea. Products containing these vapors include paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, hobby supplies, deodorizers, disinfectants, and cleaners. Formaldehyde is another organic vapor that can trigger similar signs. Formaldehyde can be discovered in brand-new construction materials, such as plywood, paneling, particle, and fiberboard board, and in cigarette smoke and numerous consumer items.<p>

As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't believe enough about direct exposure to all the important things we position in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
