<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and work environments matters, particularly given that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. A/c help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely humid climates or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity.

A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In many split-system air conditioning unit, this indoor cabinet likewise includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump. The air conditioner's evaporator coil is set up in the cabinet or primary supply duct of this furnace or heat pump. If your home already has no air however a furnace conditioner, a split-system is the most economical central air conditioning conditioner to set up.<p>
