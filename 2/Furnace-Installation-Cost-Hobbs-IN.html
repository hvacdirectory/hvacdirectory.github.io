It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
