Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really helpful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
