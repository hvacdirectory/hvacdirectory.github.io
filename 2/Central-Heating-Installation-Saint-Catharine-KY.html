Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
