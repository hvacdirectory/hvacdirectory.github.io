<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for several years.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
