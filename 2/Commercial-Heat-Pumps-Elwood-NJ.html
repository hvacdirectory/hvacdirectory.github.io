They can lead to a harmful build-up and compromise your safety if the exhaust outlets are blocked.

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
