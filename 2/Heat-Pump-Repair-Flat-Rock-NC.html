<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges utilized harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores. The primary threat of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than a lot of allergenic properties is the ability of mold to activate episodes personallies that already have asthma, a major breathing illness.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might grovel twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a few years back.<p>
<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales man concerns your house he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the choices for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
