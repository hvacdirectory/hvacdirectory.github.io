<p>There are 2 main kinds of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>

<p>Normally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Occupants of homes with poor indoor air quality might suffer symptoms such as headache, eye inflammation, fatigue, dry throat, sinus blockage, nausea, and lightheadedness. Diagnosing sick building syndrome is difficult due to the fact that many illnesses can trigger these symptoms. Exceptionally high levels of some impurities, such as carbon monoxide gas, can trigger more serious illness, including death.<p>
