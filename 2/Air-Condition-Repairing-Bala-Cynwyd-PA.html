<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
