<p>There is no easy answer, however many utilize the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better option.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, considering recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be wiser to change the whole system.<p>
