Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Womelsdorf PA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction.

The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
