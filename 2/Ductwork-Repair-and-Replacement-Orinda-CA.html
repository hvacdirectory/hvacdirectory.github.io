<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Orinda CA Home</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
