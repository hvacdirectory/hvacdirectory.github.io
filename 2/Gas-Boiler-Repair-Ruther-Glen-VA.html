Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
