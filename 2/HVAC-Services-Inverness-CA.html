<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature throughout the year.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw.
