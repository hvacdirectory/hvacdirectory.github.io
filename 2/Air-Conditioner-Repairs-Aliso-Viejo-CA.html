<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors remove impurities straight from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
