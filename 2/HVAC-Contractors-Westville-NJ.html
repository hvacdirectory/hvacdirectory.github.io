The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved issues. I would recommend this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time.
