<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
