There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Residents of homes with bad indoor air quality might experience symptoms such as headache, eye irritation, tiredness, dry throat, sinus nausea, dizziness, and blockage.
