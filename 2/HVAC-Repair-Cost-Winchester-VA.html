<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be easily integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or radiant floor heating or can be installed in a new building. Required air systems will need a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heat systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is important iin ensuring the performance and performance of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is determined in heaps. Generally, a 3-ton setup must be adequate for the typical house, but home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all elements which will influence the proper size for your particular house.

<p>Great Product! Delivery was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
