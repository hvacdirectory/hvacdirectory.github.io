<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow.

Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
