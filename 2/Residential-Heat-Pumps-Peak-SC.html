<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

<h3>Air Condition Service in Peak SC</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning system is more than 8 years old, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's a basic issue like debris clogging the condenser system or a worn fan belt.
