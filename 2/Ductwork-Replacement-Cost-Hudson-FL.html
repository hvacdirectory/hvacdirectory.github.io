<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
