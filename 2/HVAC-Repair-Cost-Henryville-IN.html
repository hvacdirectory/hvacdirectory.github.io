What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
