<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
