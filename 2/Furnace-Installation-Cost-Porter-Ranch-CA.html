<p>Appropriate ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants.
