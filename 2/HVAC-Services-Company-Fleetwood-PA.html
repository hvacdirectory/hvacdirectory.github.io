<p>Buildings are developed or intended to react actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and preserve surfaces to boost their efficiency, appearance, or durability. In other cases, such changes subtly or even drastically change structures in ways that might be essential to their own stability or their impact on building residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time.

The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
