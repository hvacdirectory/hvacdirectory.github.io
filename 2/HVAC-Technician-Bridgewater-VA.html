<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Bridgewater VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
