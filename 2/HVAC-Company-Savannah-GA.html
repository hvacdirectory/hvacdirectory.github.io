The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and collected pollutants (scaling in hard water locations). The systems ought to be checked a minimum of twice per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to remove dust gathered in order to enhance collector efficiency.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
