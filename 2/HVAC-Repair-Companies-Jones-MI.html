<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
