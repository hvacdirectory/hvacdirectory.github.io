An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Conroe TX</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the specialists thought they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
