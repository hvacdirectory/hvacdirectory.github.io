<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy.

The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
