<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on cost. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
