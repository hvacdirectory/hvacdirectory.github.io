<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Fantastic AC Repair Company in Jackson GA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out.

<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
