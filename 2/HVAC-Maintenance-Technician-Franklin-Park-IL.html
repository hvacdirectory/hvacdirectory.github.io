According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
