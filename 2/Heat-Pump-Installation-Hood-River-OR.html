<h3>Solar Heating System in Hood River OR</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine situation & chose to choose them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were very professional, polite and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in describing what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided excellent customer support at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance jobs we may want to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
