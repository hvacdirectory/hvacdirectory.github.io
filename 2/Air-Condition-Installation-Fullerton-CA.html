<p>If you have a big home, a home with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floors instead of the air might not suffice to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed. Property owners would be well advised to perform a home energy audit to evaluate where improvements might be made to increase the effectiveness of an existing HVAC system. These changes could in fact build up and potentially lower your perceived requirement for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can expect a minimum of 1 month during which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Just a few years back, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have been lots of long, dry, hot streaks since then.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has actually identified building products, home furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the threat also comes from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>The most common type of house heater in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly option, however newer systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems generally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly efficient natural gas heaters can achieve AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Heavy manufacturing markets employ a reasonably small portion of air conditioning professionals and other HVAC workers, however pay some of the industry's highest earnings. Electrical power creating companies top the list, with an average wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 per year. Car parts makers, aerospace manufacturers and auto makers are all within a few cents of each other at roughly $31 per hour, or over $64,000 annually. Trains are another high-wage employer, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 per year.<p>
