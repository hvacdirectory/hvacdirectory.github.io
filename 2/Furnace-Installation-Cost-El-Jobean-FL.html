<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your El Jobean FL Home</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
