<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in large commercial buildings can not be effectively recognized or remedied without a detailed building investigation. These examinations might begin with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which building private investigators assess the history of occupant signs and structure operation treatments. Sometimes, these queries might rapidly reveal the problem and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
