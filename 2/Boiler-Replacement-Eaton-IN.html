<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
