<p>Houses can have the exact same indoor air problems as single-family houses because a lot of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure products, home furnishings, and family products, are comparable.

<p>Great Item! Shipment was type of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets.
