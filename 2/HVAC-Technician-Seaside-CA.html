<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
