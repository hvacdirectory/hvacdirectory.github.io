<p>Central air systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it is essential to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that might be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
