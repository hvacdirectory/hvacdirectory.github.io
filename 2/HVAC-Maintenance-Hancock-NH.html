<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Hancock NH</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are normally smaller sized than stick-built homes and use considerably less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Anticipate the average mobile home oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500. Remember that not as many brands produce oil heating systems for this usage, and you may discover more options with natural gas, gas, or electric heating systems.<p>
