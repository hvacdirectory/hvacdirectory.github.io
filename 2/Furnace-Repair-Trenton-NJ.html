Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
