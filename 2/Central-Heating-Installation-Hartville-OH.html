Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2).

<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Hartville OH</h3>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
