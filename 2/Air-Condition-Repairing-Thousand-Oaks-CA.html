<h3>Water Boiler Repair in Thousand Oaks CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
