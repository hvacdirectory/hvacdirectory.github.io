<p>Stability Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new furnaces can heat the house.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
