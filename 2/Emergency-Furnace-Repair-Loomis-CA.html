<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Loomis CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are normally not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however the majority of do not attain an efficiency greater than 90%. A few high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more expensive, having beginning expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain requires to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
