Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have.
