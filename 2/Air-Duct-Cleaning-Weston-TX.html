<p>Particular instant results are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically tough to identify if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is important to take note of the time and place the signs happen. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is away from the house and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
