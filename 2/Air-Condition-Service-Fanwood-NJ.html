However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture inside is associated with a higher occurrence of resident breathing problems.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can suggest your house might not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might end up being a source for mold development and must be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in surprise or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
