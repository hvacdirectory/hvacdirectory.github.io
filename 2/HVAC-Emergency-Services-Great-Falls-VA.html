<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
