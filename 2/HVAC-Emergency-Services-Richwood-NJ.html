<p>Considering that pesticides can be discovered far from the website of their original application, it is prudent to reduce using chemical pesticides outdoors along with inside. Depending upon the site and pest to be managed, several of the following steps can be efficient: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and regular cleaning of indoor plants and animals.
