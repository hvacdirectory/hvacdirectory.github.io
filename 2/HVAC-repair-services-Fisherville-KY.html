Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
