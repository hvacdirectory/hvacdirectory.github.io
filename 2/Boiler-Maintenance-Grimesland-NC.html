<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they identified the issue and fixed very quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
