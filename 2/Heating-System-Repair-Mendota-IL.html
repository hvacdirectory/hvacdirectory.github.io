Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
