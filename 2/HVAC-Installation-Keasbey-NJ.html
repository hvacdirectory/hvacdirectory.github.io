<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location.

For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature deterioration, causing cracks and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
