<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning provides maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air.<p>
