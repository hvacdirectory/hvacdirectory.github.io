<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors.
