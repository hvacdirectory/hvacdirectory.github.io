<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
