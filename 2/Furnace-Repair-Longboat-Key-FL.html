<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be polluted (because of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread these toxins throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread toxins from one portion of the home to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can help reduce these problems.<p>
