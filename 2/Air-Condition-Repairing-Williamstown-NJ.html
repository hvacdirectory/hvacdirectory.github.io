<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
