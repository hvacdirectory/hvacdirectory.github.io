<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
