<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that include owning a high-demand, seasonal business. A thoroughly crafted business plan for an HVAC company is the primary step to manage those lulls and peaks so your profits stay healthy year-round. If you didn't create a heating & cooling company plan when you began your business, it's not too late to develop one now, or to give your initial strategy an upgrade.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can typically be performed in simply a couple of minutes, typically without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
