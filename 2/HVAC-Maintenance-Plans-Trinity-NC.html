Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
