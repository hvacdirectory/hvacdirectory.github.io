<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can often be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests performed.
