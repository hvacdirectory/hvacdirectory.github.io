<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and hospitals, vehicles such as cars, trains, submarines, ships and airplanes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
