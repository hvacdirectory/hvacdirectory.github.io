<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
