<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

No extra charge.<p>
