<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Pelham NH</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in home building is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
