<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one reaction stated the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system do not just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.. a very helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
