<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on.

Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service individual need to be required almost any maintenance aside from routine cleaning.

While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
