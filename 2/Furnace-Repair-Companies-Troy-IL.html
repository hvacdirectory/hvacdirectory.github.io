Sometimes, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on private sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, oil or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific.
