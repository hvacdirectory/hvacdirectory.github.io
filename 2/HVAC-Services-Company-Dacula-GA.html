For example, he might seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient option to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a standard forced air heater. Radiant heat systems tend to be much more energy effective than other heaters, for something.
