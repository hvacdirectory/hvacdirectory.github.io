<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Hardinsburg KY?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
