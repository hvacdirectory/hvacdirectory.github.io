<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Greeleyville SC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
