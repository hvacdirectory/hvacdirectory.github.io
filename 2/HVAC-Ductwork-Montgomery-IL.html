<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
