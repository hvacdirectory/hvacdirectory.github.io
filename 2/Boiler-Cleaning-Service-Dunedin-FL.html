<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now.

He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite.
