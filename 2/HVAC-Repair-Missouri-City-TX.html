<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It may likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
