<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Lawrence Township NJ</h3>
<p>Sean was really useful. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
