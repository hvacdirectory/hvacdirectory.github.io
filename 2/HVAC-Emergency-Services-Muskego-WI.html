<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts decades, given that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
