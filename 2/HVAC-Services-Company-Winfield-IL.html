<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Winfield IL</h3>
<p>Call Miller's Cooling & Heating at (925) 447-3000 and always talk with a live and helpful  member of our group, who will immediately focus on your requirements. While our competitors punch a rigorous time clock, we understand heating and cooling difficulties often arise outside of regular organisation hours.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
