<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heating systems that kick on often might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem.
