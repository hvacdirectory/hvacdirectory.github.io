<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Los Osos CA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>

<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
