<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
