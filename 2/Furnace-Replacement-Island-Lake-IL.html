<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in house construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofs. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
