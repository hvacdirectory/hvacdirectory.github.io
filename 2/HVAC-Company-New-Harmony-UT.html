<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your house, supplying a comfortable climate in every room. But ducts that are not set up properly or preserved can disperse impurities from one room to another. In time, dust, dander and even mold can accumulate in your ducts, lowering the overall air quality. Hire an expert to make sure your ducts are flowing fresh, clean air.<p>

Natural ventilation plans can use really little energy, however care must be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or damp environments, keeping thermal comfort exclusively through natural ventilation might not be possible. A/c systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers likewise utilize outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when proper.<p>
