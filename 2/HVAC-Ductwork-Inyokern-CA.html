<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
