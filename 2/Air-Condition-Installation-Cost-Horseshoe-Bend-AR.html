<p>For instance, impurities might collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outside toxin, it might work as a pathway to bring the pollutants inside.

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit.

However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
