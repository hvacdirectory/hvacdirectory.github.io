<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>

<p>Outdoor impurities. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Professionals advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and normally are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
