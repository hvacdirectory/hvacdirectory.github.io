Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down totally. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can usually be performed in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
