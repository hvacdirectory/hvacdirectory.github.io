What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
