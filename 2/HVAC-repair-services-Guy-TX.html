<p>Heaters as they age run the risk of establishing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, might leakage into your home undetected.

Must you experience any of these, air out your home, open a window to the furnace space and right away call a service technician.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a couple of years earlier.<p>
