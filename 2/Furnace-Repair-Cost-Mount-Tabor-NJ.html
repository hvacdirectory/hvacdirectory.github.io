<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>

It wasn't up until later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they learnt more about and executed indoor air quality monitoring to provide a healthier, safer structure environment-- and to head off the negative repercussions connected with indoor air pollutants.<p>
