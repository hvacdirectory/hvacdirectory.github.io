<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978.

Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
