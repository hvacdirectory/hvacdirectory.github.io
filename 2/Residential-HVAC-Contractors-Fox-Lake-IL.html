<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
