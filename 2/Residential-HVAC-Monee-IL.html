<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or wet structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.
