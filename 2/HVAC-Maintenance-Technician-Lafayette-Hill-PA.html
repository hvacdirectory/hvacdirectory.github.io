<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Lafayette Hill PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the professionals thought they just didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
