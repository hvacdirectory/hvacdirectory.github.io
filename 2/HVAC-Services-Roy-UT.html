<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
