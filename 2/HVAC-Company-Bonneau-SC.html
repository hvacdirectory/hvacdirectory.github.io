<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are often used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
