<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Heating Company in Uniondale IN</h3>
<p>Last week, Target informed press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were taken from a third party vendor.

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big merchant who asked not to be named since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy usage and temperatures in stores to minimize costs (especially at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the shops fluctuate outside of an appropriate range that might prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
