<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
