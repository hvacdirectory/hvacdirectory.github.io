<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters obstructed with dust, family pet hair and other particles lead to problems like failure to provide sufficient heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time.

<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
