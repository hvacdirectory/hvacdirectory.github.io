<p>Use or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical technique of lowering direct exposure to indoor air contaminants, likewise will minimize but not remove direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Mechanical or natural ventilation techniques do not eliminate them from the air in your house as rapidly as they build up because cigarette smoking produces such large quantities of toxins. In addition, the big increases in ventilation it takes to significantly minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. Subsequently, the most reliable method to minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>
