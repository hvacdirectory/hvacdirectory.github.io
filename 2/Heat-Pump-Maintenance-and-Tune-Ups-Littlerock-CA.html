<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
