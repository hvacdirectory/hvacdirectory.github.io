<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are generally smaller than stick-built properties and utilize substantially less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
