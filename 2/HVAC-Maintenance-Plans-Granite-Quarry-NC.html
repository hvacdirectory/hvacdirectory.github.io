The majority of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate.

<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
