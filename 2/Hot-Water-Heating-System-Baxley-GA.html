<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be changed.<p>
