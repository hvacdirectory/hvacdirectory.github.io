<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect.
