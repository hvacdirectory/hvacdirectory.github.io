Normal sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Consider possible results of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater.

While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the remainder of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
