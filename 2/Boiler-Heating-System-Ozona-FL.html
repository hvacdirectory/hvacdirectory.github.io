<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered great customer care at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance tasks we may want to have actually performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the market.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically greater than many heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the design you buy.

This suggests it can heat up your house to the desired temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
