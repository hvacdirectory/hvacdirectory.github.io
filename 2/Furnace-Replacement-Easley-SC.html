"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
