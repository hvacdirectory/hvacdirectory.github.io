<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
