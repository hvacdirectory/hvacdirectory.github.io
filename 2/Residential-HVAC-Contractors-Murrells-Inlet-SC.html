<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
