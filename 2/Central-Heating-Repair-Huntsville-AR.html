<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
