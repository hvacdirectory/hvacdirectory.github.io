In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>For example, issues emerge when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in appropriate quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a method that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Improperly located outside air intake vents can also generate air polluted with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological impurities that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
