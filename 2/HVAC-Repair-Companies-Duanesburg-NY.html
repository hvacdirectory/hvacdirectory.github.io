<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
