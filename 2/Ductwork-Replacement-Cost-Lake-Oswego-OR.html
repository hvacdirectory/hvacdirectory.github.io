<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
