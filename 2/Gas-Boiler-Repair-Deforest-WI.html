<p>Keep in mind that the SEER ranking is calculated using the same set of temperatures across the board. The typical summer temperature to get to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to reach the proper SEER rating for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking has to be at least 13 for all brand-new air conditioning systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
