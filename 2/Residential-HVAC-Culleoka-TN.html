<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Want to Understand in Culleoka TN</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are frequently set up in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
