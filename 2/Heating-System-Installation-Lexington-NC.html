Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large seller who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that consistently monitors energy intake and temperatures in stores to minimize costs (especially at night) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an appropriate variety that could prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>

At the same time, the con would be that those who use this may invest more money on cooling costs in the long run due to the fact that of the lower energy performance.<p>
