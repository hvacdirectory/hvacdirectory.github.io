The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>

He knew just what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
