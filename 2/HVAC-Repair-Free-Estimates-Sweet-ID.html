<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
