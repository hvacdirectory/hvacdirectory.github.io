If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use.

Heating systems that kick on often might be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
