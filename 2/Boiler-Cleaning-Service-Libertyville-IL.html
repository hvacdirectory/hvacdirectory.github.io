<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
