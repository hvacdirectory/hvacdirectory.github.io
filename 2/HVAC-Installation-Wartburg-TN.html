<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature level. Heaters that kick on often may be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
