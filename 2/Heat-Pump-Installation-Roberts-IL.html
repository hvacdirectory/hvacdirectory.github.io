<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust.

For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>

The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in.
