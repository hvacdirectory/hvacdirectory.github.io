<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.

Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
