<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Weaubleau MO</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
