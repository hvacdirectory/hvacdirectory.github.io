<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>The first thing that you will really need to install will be the air handler, which will can be found in your central heating system installation package. This element is normally set up in the basement of your house, set off several feet from any concrete walls. When installing this part, make sure that the condenser drain is installed in such a way that it will have the ability to drain away securely.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a few years back.<p>
