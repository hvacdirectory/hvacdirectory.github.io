<h3>What Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Fountain Inn SC?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it because it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
