<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
