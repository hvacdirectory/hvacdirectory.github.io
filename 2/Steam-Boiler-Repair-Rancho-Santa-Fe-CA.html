<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
