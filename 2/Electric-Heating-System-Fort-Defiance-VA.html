<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
