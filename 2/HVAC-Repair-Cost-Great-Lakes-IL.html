<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Great Lakes IL</h3>
<p>If your air conditioner is more than 8 years of ages, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's an easy problem like debris clogging the condenser system or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not just the condition of your existing devices, however also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those components may increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing new equipment.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas heaters While oil is traditionally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the 2 types. Gas furnaces cost about the very same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to start (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
