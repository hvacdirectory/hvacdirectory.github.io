<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and harden-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
