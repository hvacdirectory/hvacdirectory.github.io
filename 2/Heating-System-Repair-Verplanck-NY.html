<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the maker's directions.<p>
