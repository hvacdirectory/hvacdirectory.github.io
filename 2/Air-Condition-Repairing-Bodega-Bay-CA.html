<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your home can be worse than the air exterior.

<p>Consider possible results of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit.

While an area heating unit remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
