<h3>Gas Boiler Repair in Nyssa OR</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
