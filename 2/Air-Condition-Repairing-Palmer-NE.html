<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years back and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the present one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
