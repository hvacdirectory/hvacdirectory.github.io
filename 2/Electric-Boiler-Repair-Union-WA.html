Our technicians explain all of your options before beginning the repair, so you can choose whether a repair or replacement is best for you.

<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace because it's the most typical heater in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency.
