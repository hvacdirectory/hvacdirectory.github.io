<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
