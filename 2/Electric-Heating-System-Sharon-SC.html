Since they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
