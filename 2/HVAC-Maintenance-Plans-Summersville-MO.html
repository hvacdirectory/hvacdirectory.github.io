<p>Expert heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the price of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy efficient than designs made 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's five years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while delivering the same quantity of cooling.<p>
