<p>As a knowledgeable HVAC professional, we suggest you have your systems examined and routine maintenance carried out two times each year, when in the Spring (prior to cooling season) and as soon as in the Fall (before heating season).

<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperatures often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness indoors is connected with a higher occurrence of occupant breathing problems.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the quantity (and often quality) of outside air that need to be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
