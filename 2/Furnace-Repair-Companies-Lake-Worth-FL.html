<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
