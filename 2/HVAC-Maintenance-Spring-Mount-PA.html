<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>

<p>To be truthful, few of the centers supervisors who use our indoor air quality tracking service pertained to us because of that. Usually they were at first interested in remotely keeping an eye on some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't till later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they found out about and carried out indoor air quality keeping an eye on to offer a healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to avoid the unfavorable effects connected with indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Outdoor pollutants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers.
