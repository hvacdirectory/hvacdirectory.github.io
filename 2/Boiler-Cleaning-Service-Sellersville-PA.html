<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
