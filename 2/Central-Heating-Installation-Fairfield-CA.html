<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Fairfield CA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
