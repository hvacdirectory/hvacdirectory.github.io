<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Essentially, SEER provides more information based on how the EER performs in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
