<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Brookhaven MS</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
