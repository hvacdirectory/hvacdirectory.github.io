<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
