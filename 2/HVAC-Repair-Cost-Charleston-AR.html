<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
