We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
