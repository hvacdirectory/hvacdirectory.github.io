<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Willis TX</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in house construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
