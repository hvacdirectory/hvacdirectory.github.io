<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
