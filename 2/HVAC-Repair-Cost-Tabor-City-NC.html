<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
