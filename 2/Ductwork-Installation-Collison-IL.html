<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we offer recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently.

If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400?
