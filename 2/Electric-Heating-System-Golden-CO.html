And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system regularly.<p>
