<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and workplaces matters, especially considering that we spend the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.
