<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
