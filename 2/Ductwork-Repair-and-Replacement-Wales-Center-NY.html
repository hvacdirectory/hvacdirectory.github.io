<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Houses can have the very same indoor air problems as single-family homes due to the fact that many of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and household products, are similar. Indoor air issues similar to those in workplaces are caused by such sources as infected ventilation systems, incorrectly placed outside air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and wetness inside is associated with a greater prevalence of resident breathing problems.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
