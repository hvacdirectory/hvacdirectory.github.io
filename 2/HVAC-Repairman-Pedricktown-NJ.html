<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Pedricktown NJ?</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
