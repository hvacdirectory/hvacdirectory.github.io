<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Consider possible impacts of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
