<h3>How to Maintain Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Indian Hills CO</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I must state it does the job rather well.

The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>

But more complex issues-- determined by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the 3 techniques below might be proper.<p>
