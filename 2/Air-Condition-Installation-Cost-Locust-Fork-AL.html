<p>Similar to the majority of house enhancement tasks, the cost of a full central heating system can differ widely based upon the size of the house. Most heaters will last between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
