<p>I have been using Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are really well-informed and expert. Expenses are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week.

<p>Initially make sure the air filter is clean and in great condition if you notice a decrease in heat output. Next, check other parts of the furnace for any build-up of debris, dust and dirt, an inexpensive repair that can assist boost efficiency. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage. Lastly, make certain the thermostat is working and located correctly. Try moving it far from direct sunlight considering that this might affect temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature level in your home. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your house feeling cold if this takes place. You may also need to examine your insulation to make sure that warm air does not leave from your space through different openings.<p>
