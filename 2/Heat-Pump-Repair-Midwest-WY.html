By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>It's not suggested for uncertified people to repair & check cooling & HVAC devices. There is a risk of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to a qualified ac repair Houston Midtown tech for correct HVAC medical diagnosis, it would be best. When checking your air conditioning equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, constantly make sure.
