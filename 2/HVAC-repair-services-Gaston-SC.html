<p>Consumer products which contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to trigger cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms connected with direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas. Thoroughly read the labels including health danger information and cautions on the proper use of these items. Use items that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use inside only if the area is well aerated.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems come with a number of special features that can even more enhance performance and effectiveness. For example, property owners might wish to look for one that comes with an integrated filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to reduce energy expenses even more. Of course, more features mean higher central air expenses.<p>
