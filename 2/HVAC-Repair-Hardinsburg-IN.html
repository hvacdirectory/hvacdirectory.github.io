<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Hardinsburg IN</h3>
<p>When building your new home a well-functioning Heating and Cooling system is essential, in addition to the air quality you breathe inside. We have the experience and resources necessary to help from the planning stages through to the last installation. We use the current software application to assist create your ductwork system and use the greatest quality products in the building and construction and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
