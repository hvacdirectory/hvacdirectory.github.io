<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine.

<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair at Marengo IL</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
