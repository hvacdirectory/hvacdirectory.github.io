<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Greenwood</h2>

To ensure the system you select is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation quote to determine the exact kind of heat and a/c system that's just right for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size unit you presently have.

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated performance benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts.

Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
