<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted two local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and useful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better offer, for remarkable service.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
