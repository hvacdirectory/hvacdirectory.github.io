<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that collects during summer seasons. The best thing to do is making sure that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned completely before chillier seasons start. Constantly make certain that the furnace is cleaned up every year to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working appropriately. If your furnace is in a very bad condition, perhaps it is time to start thinking of buying a new one.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
