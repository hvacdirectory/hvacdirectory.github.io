<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure products, smoking, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in manufactured items. For instance, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and covering products.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures build up indoors, direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
