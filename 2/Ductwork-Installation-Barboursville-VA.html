<p>Heating systems resemble automobiles. As they age, you can change one part just need another part changed or fixed next year.

A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
