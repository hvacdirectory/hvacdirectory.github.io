<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation).
