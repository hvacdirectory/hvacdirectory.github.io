<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in collecting info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
