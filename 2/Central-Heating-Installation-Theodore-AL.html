Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation business completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter season utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
