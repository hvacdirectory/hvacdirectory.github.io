<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>

The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
