The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.

<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
