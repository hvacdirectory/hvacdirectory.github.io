<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
