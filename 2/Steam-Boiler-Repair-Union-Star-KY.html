As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
