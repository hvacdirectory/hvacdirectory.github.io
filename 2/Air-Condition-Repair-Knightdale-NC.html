<h3>Best Central Air Conditioner in Knightdale NC</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
