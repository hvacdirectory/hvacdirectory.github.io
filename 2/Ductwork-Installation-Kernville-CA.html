<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run because it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
