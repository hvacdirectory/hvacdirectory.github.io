A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
