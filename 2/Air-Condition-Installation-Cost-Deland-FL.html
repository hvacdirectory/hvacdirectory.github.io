<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.
