<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
