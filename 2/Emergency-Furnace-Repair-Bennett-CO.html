<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical energy, a heat pump is a cost-effective service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other perks. Some companies provide concern visits to their maintenance plan members.<p>

They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
