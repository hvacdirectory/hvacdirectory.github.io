Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be set up in a brand-new structure.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>
