<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
