<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be required to lessen pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, citizens must be alert to the development of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures should not be carried out till these issues have been corrected.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we offer guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher every year, we know the unit is not running effectively.
