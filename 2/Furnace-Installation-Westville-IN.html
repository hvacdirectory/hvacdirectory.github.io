<p>My oldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
