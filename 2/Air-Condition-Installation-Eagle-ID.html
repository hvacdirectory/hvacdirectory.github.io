<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
