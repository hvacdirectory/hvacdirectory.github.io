<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Pleasantville NJ</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioning unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
