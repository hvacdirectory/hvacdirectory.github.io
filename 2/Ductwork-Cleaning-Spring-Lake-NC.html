<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove pollutants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
