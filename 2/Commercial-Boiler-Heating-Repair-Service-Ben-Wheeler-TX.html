<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.
