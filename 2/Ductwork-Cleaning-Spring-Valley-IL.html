<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
