The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
