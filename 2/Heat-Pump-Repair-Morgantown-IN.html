Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>

The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
