<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
