<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
