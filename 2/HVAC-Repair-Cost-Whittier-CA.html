<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working, stability Energy was quick to react. They showed up the next day and changed 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heaters can heat your home. Truthfully, our home heating unit is made complex, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
