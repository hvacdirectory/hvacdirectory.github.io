<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
