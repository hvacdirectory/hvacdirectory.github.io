<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every four years. The Fundamentals Handbook consists of heating and cooling estimations. The style professional must seek advice from ASHRAE information for the requirements of design and care as the common building regulations provide little to no info on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful reference materials include products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very vital to preserving an appropriate temperature level.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>
