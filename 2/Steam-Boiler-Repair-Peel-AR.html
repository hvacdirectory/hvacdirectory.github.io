<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Peel AR</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofs.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not limited to homes. In reality, many office buildings have significant air contamination sources A few of these structures may be inadequately ventilated. For example, mechanical ventilation systems may not be created or operated to provide adequate amounts of outside air. Lastly, people typically have less control over the indoor environment in their workplaces than they carry out in their homes. As a result, there has been an increase in the occurrence of reported health problems.<p>
