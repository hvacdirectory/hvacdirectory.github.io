<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run because it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
