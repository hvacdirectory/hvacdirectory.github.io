<p>The primary reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services used. If the system is brand-new and still under a maker's service warranty, the cost may not be rewarding. Any major repairs must be covered under the producer's service warranty.

<p>The steadiness of the market's development does not necessarily equate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The ventilation, air and heating conditioning service tends to run cold and hot.
