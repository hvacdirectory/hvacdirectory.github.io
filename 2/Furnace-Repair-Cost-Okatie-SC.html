Local building codes likely define the quantity (and often quality) of outdoor air that should be continually supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation paired with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
