Various fungi and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
