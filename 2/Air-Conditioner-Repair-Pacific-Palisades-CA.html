If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
