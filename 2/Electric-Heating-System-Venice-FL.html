A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER score in energy performance would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to install.

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and performance if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the extremely hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
