<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2).
