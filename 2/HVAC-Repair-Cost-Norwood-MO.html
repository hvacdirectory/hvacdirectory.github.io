<p>Seattle furnaces can run nine months of the year. Based upon the typical temperature levels in our area, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life-span of 15 years. Your heating unit will strive for you, but like your car, doing regular and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid problems, and keep your guarantee undamaged.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate.
