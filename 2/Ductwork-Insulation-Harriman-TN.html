<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Harriman TN</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
