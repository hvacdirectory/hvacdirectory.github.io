<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up.
