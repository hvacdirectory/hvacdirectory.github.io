Many common structure products used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation.
