<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Gallaway TN</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
