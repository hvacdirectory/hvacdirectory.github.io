Their techs are professional and very experienced. Expenses are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser today.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that change it ON.

You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
