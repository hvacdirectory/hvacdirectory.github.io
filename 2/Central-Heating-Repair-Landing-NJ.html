<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
