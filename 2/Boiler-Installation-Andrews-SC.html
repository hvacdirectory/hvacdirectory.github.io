<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
