Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

Since smoking produces such large quantities of toxins, mechanical or natural ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your home as rapidly as they develop. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it requires to considerably reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs significantly. Subsequently, the most reliable way to reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to remove cigarette smoking there.<p>
