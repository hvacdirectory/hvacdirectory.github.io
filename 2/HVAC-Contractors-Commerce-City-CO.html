<p>Air conditioner producers generally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers.

<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
