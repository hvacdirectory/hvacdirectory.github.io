<p>Seattle furnaces can run nine months of the year. Based upon the average temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years. Your heater will strive for you, but like your car, doing routine and routine maintenance will keep it running smoothly, prevent problems, and keep your guarantee undamaged.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was really extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn supplied fantastic client service at the end of the visit by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater.

<p>Stability Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new furnaces can heat the house.

<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
