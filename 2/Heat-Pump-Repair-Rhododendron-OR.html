<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
