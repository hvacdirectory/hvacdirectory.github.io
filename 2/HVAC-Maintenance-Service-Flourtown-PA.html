<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
