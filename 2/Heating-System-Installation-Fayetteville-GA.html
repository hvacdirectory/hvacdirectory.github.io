<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a big retailer who asked not to be named since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in shops to save money on expenses (especially in the evening) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the shops change beyond an appropriate range that might avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however many use the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a better option. If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
