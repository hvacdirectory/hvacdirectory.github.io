A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service individual need to be called for nearly any maintenance besides routine cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners should be professionally checked and adjusted prior to the beginning of every cooling season. Nevertheless, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
