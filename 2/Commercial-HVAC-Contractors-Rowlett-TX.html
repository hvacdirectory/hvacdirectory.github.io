<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application, it is prudent to reduce using chemical pesticides outdoors in addition to inside.
