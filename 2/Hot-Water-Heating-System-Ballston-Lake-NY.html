<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Ballston Lake NY?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
