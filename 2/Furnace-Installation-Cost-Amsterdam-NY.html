<h3>Benefits of Professional AC Repair in Amsterdam NY</h3>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
