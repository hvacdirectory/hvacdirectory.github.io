<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Mead NE</h3>
<p>First, unlike central air, you have a few choices when it comes to central heating unit. We'll jump into expenses later on, however you can pick from a heat, boiler or furnace pump. In general, heating systems are the most economical choice. However, your choice will mostly boil down to what your ducts enable or what was previously in your home. Ask your heating contractor for the most proper choice.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the specialists believed they simply didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
