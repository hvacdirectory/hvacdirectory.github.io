<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>

<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is enabled to increase and stream out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack result ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation schemes can utilize extremely little energy, however care must be taken to guarantee comfort. In humid or warm environments, preserving thermal convenience entirely through natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups.

The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future.
