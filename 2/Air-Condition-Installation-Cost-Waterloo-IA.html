<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the convected heat system has been running for a while, consisting of individuals.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
