<p>Professional heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same duration.

The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
