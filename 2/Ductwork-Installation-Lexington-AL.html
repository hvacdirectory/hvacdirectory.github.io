<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Bear in mind that the SEER score is calculated using the same set of temperatures across the board. The average summertime temperature level to get to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the correct SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking has to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning units made in the United States.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
