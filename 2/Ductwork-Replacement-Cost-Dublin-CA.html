A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external system.

<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, particularly if you make it part of a build or renovation project. For instance, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be set up as a DIY project as it is easy to lay down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily attached to the mesh, ready to be rolled out in place. Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the spaces dust-free is simpler without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running.
