<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
