<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Packwaukee WI</h3>
<p>If your ac system is more than eight years old, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's an easy problem like particles blocking the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to examine not just the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those aspects may increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new equipment.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the tools or skills essential to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician examine the system periodically.<p>
