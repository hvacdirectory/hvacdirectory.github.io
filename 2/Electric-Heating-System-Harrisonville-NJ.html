<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Harrisonville NJ</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<h3>Truth All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Harrisonville NJ</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
