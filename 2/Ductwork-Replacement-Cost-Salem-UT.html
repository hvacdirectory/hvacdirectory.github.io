<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
