<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
