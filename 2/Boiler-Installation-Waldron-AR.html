Such info can often be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping track of data is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
