<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>When we redesign or include on a space, we often set up little built-in electric space heaters. Unlike heatpump, these systems are self-contained.
