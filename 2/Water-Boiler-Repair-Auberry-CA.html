Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. When every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
