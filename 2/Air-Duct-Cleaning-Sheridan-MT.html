An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
