<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
