<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of unusual being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
