<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
