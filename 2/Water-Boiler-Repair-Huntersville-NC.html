<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Huntersville NC</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, furnishings, and home products like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less constantly. Other sources, associated to activities performed in the home, release toxins periodically. These include smoking, the use of unvented or malfunction-ing stoves, heaters, or area heating units, the use of solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, making use of paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in house cleaning. High toxin concentrations can stay in the air for extended periods after some of these activities.<p>
