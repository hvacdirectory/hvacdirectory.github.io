<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Specialist heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
