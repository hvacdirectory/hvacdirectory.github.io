<p>Specialist heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this standard guideline when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>
