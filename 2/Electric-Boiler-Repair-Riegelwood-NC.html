Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On."
