<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Wilmette IL?</h3>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
