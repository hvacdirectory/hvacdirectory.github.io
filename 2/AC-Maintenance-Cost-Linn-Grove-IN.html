<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
