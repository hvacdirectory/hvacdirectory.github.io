<h3>Central Heating System in Chokoloskee FL</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
