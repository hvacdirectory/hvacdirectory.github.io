<p>Certain instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically hard to identify if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is important to focus on the time and place the symptoms happen. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is away from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be made worse by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heat systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because forced air heating systems flow airborne contaminants throughout the home during operation, provoking a range of various negative effects. Radiant heating systems do not flow air at all, which in fact improves your indoor air quality by restricting your exposure to high levels of air-borne pollutants.<p>

<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher incomes for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or merely a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest typical wages for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
