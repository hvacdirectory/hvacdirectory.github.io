<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace because it's the most common heater in Seattle houses.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems.

PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heatpump While space cooling provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
