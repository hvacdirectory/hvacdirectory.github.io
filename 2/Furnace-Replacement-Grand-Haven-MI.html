<p>Learn More About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a portion effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
