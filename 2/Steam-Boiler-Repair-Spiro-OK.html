<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
