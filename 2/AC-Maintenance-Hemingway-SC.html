<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to measure, as one response stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
