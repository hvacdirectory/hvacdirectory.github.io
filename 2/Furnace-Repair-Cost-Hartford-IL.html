<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Hartford IL</h3>

The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
