<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
