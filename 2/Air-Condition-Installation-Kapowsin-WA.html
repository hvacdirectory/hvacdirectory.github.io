<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
