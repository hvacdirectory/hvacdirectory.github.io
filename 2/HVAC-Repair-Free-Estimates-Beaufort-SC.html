<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
