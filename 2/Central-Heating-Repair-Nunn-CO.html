<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
