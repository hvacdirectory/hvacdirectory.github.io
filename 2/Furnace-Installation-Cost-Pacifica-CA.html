When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy.
