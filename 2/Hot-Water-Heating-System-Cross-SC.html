<p>There are a few possibilities to describe short biking in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the extremely low temperatures.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
