<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Avondale PA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
