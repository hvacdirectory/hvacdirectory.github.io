<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a distribution system. Metal pipelines are seldom used due to long-term corrosive issues. Practically all hydronic glowing floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely versatile, won't rust and comes in long lengths, which permit PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. Most modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the circulation system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ).

The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
