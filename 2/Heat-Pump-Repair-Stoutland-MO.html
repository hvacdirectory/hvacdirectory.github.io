<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a distribution system. Metal pipelines are seldom used due to long-term corrosive issues. Practically all hydronic glowing floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping.

The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
