<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
