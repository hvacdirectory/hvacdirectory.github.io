<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Pleasant Grove AL</h3>
<p>In basic, ductless AC units are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than traditional A/cs. This is due to the fact that you can shut off individual spaces when you're not inhabiting them. On top of that, ductless Air conditionings can raise and lower their temperature quickly, saving you energy and money that regular HVAC compressors will squander by continuously starting up and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
