<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most economical if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short biking in very cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the extremely low temperatures.

There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our technicians if you require clarity on this concern.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air.
