<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time.

<h3>Air Condition System in Marilla NY</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
