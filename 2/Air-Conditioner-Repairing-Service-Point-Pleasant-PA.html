<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay items. Because they just partially eliminate the radon decay products and do not diminish the amount of radon going into the house, the effectiveness of these devices is uncertain. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reliable means of lowering the health danger from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies more information on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
