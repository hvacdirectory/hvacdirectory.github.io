<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your house is located, the local area's climate can change dramatically. A house located in the South would need an AC system with a size efficient in cooling your house due to heat Summers. A house in the Northern part of the US would need a much bigger heating capacity as well which will impact costs.
