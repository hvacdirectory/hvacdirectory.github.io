<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
