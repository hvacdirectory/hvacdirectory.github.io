<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>The primary health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
