<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements.

<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are utilized to seeing this type in the backyards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal components as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous spaces simultaneously, but are not very energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home.
