<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heatpump While space cooling provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
