<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Grand Rapids MI</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is dirty or clogged up Before trying to fix any problem, require time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Inspect the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it if the air filter is great to go. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. Call a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
