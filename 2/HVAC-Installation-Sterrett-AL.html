<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

By getting to know more about an HVAC provider prior to you call, you'll know whether they are the best company to handle the service or concern you need them for.<p>
