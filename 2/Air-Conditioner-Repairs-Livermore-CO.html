<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
