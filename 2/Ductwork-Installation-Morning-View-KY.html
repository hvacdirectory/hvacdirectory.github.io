Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down totally. By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be done in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools required.

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>People who are allergic to these toxins must utilize allergen-proof mattress encasements, wash bed linen in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent room home furnishings that build up dust, particularly if they can not be washed in hot water.

Utilizing central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high effectiveness filters may also be of help.<p>
