<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
