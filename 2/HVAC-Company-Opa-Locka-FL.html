<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
