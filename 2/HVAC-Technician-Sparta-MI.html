<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers.
