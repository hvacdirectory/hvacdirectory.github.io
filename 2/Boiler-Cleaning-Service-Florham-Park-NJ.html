<p>Specific immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to figure out if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination.

If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Never Ignore Florham Park NJ</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
