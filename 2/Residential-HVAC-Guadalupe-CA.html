<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
