<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He assisted me problem shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
