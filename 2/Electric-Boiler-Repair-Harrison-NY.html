<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part.

<p>Specific types of HVAC systems are a little bit more pricey than wall units, ceiling or cassette units are neatly concealed inside the ceiling in the class and are for that reason more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to take a look at.
