<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years.

<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Sheridan IN</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
