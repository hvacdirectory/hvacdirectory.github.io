<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Natural Dam AR</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins given off by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the entire surface of a flooring heats the lower half of the space, covering residents in heat at a lower total temperature-- sometimes approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heater." To put it simply, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of comfort. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more likely we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
