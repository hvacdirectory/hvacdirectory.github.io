<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at San Mateo CA</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
