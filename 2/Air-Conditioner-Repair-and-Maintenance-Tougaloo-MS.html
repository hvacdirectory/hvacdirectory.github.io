<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
