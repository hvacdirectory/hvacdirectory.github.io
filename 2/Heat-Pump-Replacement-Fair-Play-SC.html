Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, tiredness, trouble concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and moisture inside is associated with a higher prevalence of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC professionals typically discover themselves operating in cramped and unpleasant areas, at extreme heights, and sometimes in unsafe conditions like severe weather (to service outside heat pumps and heat exchangers). They deal with various possible threats, including electrical shocks, burns, muscle stress from lifting heavy devices, and breathing problems triggered by the harmful chemicals and refrigerants they manage.<p>
