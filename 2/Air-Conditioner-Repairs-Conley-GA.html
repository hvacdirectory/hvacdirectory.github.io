<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
