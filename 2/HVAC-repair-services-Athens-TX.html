<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
