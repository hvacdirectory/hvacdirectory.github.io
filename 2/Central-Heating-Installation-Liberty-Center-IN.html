Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
