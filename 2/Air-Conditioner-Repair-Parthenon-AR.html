<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>

Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions.
