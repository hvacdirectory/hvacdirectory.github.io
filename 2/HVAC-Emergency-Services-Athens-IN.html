<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can imply considerable savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
