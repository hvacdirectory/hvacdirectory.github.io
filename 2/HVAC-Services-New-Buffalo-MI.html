For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat irritant might bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
