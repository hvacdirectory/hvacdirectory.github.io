<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Production combines quality items and impressive service with development and technological advances to provide high-performance cooling and heating products worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external system.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
