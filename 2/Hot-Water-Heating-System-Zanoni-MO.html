<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Experts advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
