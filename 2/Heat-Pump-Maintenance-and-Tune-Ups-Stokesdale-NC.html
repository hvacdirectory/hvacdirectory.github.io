<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; furnishings, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Air, heating and ventilation Conditioning, and describes the environment control systems installed in homes or commercial residential or commercial properties. Their job is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the structure, to keep residents of the structure comfy. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of climate control system installed.<p>
