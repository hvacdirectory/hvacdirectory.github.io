<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the home. Pollutants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air toxin could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
