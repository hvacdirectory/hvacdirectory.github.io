<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very practical in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.
