<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp connectors ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
