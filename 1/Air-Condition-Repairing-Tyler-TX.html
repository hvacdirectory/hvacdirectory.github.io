The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 major parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

It wasn't until later on, as they continued working with us, that they learned about and implemented indoor air quality keeping track of to provide a much healthier, much safer building environment-- and to head off the unfavorable repercussions related to indoor air pollutants.<p>
