<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this.
