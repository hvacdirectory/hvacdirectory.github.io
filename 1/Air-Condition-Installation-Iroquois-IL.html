<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
