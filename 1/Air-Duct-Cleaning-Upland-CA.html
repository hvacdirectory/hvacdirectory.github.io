<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
