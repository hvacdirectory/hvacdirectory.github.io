<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Staunton</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
