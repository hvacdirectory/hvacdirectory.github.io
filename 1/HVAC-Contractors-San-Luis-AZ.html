<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
