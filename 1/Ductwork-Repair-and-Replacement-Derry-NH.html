<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
