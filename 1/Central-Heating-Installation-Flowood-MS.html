<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Flowood MS</h3>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Flowood MS</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
