<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
