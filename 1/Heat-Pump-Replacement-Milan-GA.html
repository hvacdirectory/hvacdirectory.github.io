Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation.
