<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>

<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace must likewise be checked regularly. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire hazard.

<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
