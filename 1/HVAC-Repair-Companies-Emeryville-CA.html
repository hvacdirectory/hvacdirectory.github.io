<p>Structures are developed or planned to react actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and preserve surface areas to boost their appearance, performance, or longevity. In other cases, such changes subtly and even drastically alter buildings in ways that might be essential to their own integrity or their effect on building residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the techniques utilized by scientists studying communities, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big commercial and office complex such as skyscrapers and hospitals, lorries such as cars, trains, planes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
