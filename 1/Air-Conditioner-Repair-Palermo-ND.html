<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
