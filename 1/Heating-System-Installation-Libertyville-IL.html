<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
