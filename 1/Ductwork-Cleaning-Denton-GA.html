<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Trane central air conditioners are understood for maintaining guarantees and provides a standard 10-year service warranty that covers both parts and labor.

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
