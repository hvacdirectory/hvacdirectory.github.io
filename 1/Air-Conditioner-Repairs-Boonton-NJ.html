<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter season can worsen problems.
