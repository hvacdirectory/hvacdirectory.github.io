The best times of the year to do such a job remain in the months in which homes are not using their heater.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output.
