<p>Some biological impurities activate allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health issue caused by biological contaminants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and understand.<p>
