He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up assessment results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
