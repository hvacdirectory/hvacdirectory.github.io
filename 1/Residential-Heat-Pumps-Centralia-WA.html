<h3>Furnace Repair in Centralia WA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
