<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Lorton VA Home Owners</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself.

It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
