Location control involves moving the contaminant source away from occupants or perhaps moving vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time inside your home, nowadays. While many individuals assume pollution is simply an outside problem, your home (and workplace) can also be contaminated.

The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right now, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
