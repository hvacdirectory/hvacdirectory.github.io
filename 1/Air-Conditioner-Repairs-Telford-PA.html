<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, houses and schools matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
