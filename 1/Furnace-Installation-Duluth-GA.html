<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other toxins that can not only unclean up the air, but cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products add to poor air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Lots of AC units include a variety of special features that can further improve performance and effectiveness. For example, homeowners might wish to try to find one that comes with an integrated filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to lower energy expenses even more. Naturally, more features imply higher central air conditioning expenses.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
