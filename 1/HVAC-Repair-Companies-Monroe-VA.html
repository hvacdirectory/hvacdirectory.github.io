<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family home installation company entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
