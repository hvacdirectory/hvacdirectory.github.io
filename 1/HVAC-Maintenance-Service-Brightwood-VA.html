<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a solution. A trained technician needs to repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>HVAC Cleaning in Brightwood VA</h3>
<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by a lot of public water materials, it has been discovered in well water. If you've evaluated the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, call a laboratory accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Before you go out and purchase an a/c, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioner and shorten its life. Too little and your ac system won't have the ability to cool your home appropriately. These are just a few of the elements that you need to consider when shopping for a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will substantially affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>When car air conditioning systems break down, refrigerant leaks. Not just is refrigerant damaging to the environment, it's also hazardous to your cars and truck. Leaking refrigerant can harm your vehicle's evaporator and compressor. Getting a car ac system service at the first indication of trouble will save you both cash and time. Concern Firestone Total Vehicle Care for an AC service repair prior to any damage spreads.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires managed by experts, visit Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
