<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
