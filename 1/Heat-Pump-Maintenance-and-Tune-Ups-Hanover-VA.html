<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
