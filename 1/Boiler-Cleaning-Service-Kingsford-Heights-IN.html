<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
