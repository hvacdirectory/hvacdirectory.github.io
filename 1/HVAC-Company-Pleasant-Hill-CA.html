<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Pleasant Hill CA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
