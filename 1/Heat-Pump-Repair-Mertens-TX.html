Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
