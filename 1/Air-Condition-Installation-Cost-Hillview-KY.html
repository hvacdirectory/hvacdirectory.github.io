<p>Heat Exchanger Replacement: â $ " Â The heat exchanger is at the really core of the furnace.

The number of hours it takes often triggers the repair to be more expensive than the furnace was or a brand-new one would be.

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Hillview KY</h3>
<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are great that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
