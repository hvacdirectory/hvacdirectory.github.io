<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Harrison NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
