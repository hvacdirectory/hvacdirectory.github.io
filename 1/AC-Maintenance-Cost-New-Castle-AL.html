<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
