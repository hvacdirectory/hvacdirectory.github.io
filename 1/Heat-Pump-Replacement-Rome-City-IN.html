<h3>HVAC Company in Rome City IN</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on uncommon occasions.<p>
