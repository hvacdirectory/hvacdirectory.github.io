<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay items. The efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain since they only partly get rid of the radon decay items and do not decrease the quantity of radon entering the home. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trusted means of decreasing the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies further info on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
