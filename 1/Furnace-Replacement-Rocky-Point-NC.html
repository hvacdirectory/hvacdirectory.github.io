<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
