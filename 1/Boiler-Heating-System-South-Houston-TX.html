EPA studies of human direct exposure to air toxins suggest that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the leading 5 environmental health dangers to the general public.<p>

These elements consist of poor ventilation (lack of outside air), problems managing temperature level, low or high humidity, recent improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure.
