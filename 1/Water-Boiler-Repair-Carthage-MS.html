<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators.

Radiant heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
