<p>Companies are needed to follow the General Task Stipulation of the OSHAct, which requires them to supply employees with a safe workplace that does not have any known risks that trigger or are most likely to trigger death or serious injury.

<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Because it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
