The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system.
