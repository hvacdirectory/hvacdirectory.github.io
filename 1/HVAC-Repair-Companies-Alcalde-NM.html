<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
