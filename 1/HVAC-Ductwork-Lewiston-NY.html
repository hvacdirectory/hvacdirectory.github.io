<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is a really typical repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensing unit changed as preventative maintenance because the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
