First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing solid wood items. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.
