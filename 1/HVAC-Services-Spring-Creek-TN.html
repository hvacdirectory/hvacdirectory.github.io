When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
