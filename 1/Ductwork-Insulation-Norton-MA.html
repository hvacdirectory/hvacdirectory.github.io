<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water.

More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
