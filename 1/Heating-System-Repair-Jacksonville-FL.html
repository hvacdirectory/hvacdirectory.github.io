<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
