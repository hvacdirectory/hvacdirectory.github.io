Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
