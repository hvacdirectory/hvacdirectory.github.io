<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, considering that the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.

Plus, there's even an added cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
