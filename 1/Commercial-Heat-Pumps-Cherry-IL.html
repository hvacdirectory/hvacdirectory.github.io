<p>Airflow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move airborne contaminants from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>A customized a/c that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. A standard a/c transfers heat energy out of the space since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
