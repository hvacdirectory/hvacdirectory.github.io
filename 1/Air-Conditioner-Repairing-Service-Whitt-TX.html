<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean considerable cost savings in annual heating expenses.

<p>Not all sensors work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
