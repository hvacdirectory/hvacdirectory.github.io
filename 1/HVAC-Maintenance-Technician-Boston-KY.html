<h3>Things Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Boston KY HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building products, home furnishings, and family items like air fresheners, release contaminants basically continuously.
