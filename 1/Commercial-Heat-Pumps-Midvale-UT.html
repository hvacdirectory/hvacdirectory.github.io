<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
