<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
