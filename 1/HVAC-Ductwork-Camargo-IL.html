And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
