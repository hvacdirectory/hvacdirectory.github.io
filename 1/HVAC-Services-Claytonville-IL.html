<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate considerable cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
