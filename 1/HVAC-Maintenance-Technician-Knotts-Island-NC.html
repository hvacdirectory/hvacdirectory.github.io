On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having solved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He was friendly, straightforward and a completely enjoyable individual to have around that entire time. His time and proficiency to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather uncertain diagnostic.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Heating systems as they age run the risk of developing fractures in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide gas, if present, could leak into your house undetected.

<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was sort of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>Sean was really useful. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
