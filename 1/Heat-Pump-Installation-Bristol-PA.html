<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
