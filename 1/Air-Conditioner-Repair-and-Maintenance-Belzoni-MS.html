<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
