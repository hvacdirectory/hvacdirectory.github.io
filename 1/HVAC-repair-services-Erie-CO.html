<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a significant difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
