Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it ends up being wet.<p>

A professional technician will examine the thermostat during the annual maintenance to make sure the real temperature level and the temperature on the thermostat matches. The technician needs to inspect the thermostat's performance or assess the whole HVAC system if there's a distinction in the temperature level.<p>
