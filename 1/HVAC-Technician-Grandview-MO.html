<h3>AC Unit Repair in Grandview MO</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

We bring you the most environmentally friendly choice for heating and cooling, lessening your carbon footprint while substantially decreasing energy costs.

The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
