Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. However a lot of the things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne pollutants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Concord NC</h3>
<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
