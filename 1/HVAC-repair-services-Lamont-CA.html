<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any air flow restriction will reduce the unit's performance. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that perfect temperature throughout the year.

So, make certain to change your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which usually includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
