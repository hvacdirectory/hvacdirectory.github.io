<p>The primary health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
