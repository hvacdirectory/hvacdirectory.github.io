<p>In homes, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items produced indoor use include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
