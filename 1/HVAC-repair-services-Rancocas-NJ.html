<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be done in just a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
