<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles.
