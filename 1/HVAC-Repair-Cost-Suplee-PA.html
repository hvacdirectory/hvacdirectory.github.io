<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day.
