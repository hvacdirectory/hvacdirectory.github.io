<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Thorndale PA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most economical if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
