<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
