<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
