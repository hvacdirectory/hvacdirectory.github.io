<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
