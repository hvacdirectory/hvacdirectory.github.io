<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
