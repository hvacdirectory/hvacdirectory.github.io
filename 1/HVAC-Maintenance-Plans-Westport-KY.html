<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
