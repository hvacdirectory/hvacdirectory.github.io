<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively.
