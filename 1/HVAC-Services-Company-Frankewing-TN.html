A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of numerous rooms with one external system. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioning unit there is a more effective compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor systems found in the room.<p>
