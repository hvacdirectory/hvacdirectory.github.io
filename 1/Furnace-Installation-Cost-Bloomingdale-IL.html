<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure.

<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Bloomingdale IL</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors remove pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
