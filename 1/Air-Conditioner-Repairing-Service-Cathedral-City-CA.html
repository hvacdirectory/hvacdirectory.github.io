<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be set up in a brand-new structure.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can assist you correctly size a system.<p>
