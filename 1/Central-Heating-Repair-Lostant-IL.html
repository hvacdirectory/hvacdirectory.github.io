<p>For entire house setups, it's challenging, if almost difficult, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, specifically a hydronic system. Localized radiant floor heat systems to be utilized in one or a number of spaces like restrooms, kitchens or laundry rooms are easily refurbished with electric radiant flooring heat.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
