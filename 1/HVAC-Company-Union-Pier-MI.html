<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
