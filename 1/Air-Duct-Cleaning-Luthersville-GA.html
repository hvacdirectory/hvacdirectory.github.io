<p>A geothermal heatpump offers a peaceful heating & cooling option that does not disturb your next-door neighbors with noise. In addition, the ground source heat pump is incredibly long lasting and can last you for many years with simply an extremely little amount of maintenance, a huge difference to the substantial maintenance a more traditional system requires.

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the inspection on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health risk reason and contractor laws for their choice.
