<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Services in Story</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can typically be carried out in just a few minutes, often without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
