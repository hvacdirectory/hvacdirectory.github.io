Porous products, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
