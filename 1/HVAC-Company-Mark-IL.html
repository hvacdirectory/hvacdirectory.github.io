<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and houses matters, particularly because we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
