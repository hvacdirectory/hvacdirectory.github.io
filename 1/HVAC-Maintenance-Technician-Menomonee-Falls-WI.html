<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best.

Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
