<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
