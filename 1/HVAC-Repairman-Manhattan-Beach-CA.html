<p>Biological contaminants: the biological impurities can include germs, viruses, fungi (mold), allergen irritant, animal dander, insect bio sediment, fibers and fiberglass, pollen, cockroach allergen, and so on. and might arise from insufficient maintenance and housekeeping, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or might be brought into the building by residents, seepage, or ventilation air.

<p>If you observe a decline in heat output, first ensure the air filter is tidy and in good condition. Next, check other parts of the furnace for any build-up of debris, dust and dirt, an economical repair that can help boost performance. Also, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage. Finally, make certain the thermostat is working and positioned correctly. Try moving it away from direct sunlight because this may impact temperature readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature level in your home. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your house feeling cold if this occurs.
