These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter.

COP rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have been effectively dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
