<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven.
