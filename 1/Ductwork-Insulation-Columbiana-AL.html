<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Columbiana AL</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and problem in breathing in some people exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may activate attacks in individuals with asthma. There is evidence that some individuals can establish a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually also been revealed to trigger cancer in animals and might cause cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
