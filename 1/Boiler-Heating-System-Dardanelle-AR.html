The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in Dardanelle AR</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>

<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Dardanelle AR</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
