They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My wife said that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have actually met in a long time. We need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating.
