If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
