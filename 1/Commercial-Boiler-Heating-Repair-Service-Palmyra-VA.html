<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
