<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will always be the odd problem that occasionally comes up. When you do observe your furnace behaving oddly, it is really important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you react to concerns with your furnace, the much easier they are to repair. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the problem worse, and frequently more expensive.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>The fact is, air pollution in your home can be simply as bad - or perhaps worse - than it is outdoors. And with the average American spending 87% of their life inside, you 'd think that indoor air quality would be something we 'd hear about regularly. But don't panic!

<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than options, and is not impacted by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, however instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reputable and readily available source of energy.<p>

<h3>Water Boiler Repair in Fishers IN</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Plan on investing several thousand dollars for the total system if you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home. The size of the system identifies the labor hours included to construct the system. To equip a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand name brand-new furnace or more when you think about installation costs upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
