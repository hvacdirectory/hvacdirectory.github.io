<h3>Electric Heating in Swansea SC</h3>
<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtration. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins streaming through your system.

<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be prowling in your environments.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
