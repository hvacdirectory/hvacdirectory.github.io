<p>The main reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services provided. If the system is brand-new and still under a maker's warranty, the cost may not be rewarding. Any major repairs need to be covered under the producer's warranty. However, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
