<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
