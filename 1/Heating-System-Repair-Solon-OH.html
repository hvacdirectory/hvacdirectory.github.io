<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.
