<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
