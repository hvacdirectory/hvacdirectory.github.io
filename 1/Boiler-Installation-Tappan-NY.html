The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
