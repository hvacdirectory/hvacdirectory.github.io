<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
