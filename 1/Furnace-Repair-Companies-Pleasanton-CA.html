<h3>Heater Repair in Pleasanton CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
