<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
