<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, since the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
