<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this.
