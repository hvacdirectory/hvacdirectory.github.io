<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year ago and they've been to your home for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have managed the one repair I needed well, and are constantly on-time and expert. Have actually been through a few companies over the years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I have actually had the chance to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been excellent.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a mild environment, where the temperature does not get too low or too high. In other words, they are perfect for our Seattle climate! They are extremely efficient, beating out most other types of heating systems in efficiency. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. Nevertheless, a geothermal installation typically costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which generally suggests it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>
