The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
