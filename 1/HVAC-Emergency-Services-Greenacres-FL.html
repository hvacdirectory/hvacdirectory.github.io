<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Great Product! Shipment was type of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved concerns. I would recommend this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
