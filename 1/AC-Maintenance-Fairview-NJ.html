<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your medical professional about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
