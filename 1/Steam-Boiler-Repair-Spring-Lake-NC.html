<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
