Just as with switches, somebody might have switched off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on.

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Arlington VA</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I proceeded and bought this Provider and I should say it does the job quite well. It takes very little time to heat up or cool down your house which is among the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
