<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>The installation was quickly, expert and very well done. The installers were respectful and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge quickly individuals who are good at what they do.
