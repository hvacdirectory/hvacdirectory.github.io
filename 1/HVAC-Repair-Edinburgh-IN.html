<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as a vehicle radiator or common home ac system does.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
