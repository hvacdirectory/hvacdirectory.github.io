Consult your state health or housing department for recommendations on which public firms or private labs may have the ability to help test your home for lead in paint.

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
