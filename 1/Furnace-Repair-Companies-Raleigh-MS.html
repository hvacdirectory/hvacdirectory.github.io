<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
