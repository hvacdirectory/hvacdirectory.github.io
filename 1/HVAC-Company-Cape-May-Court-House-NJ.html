<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may observe undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
