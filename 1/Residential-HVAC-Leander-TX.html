Installation aside, you will still require to call out a qualified electrical contractor to link the system to your power supply, this may take a few hours and can cost anything in between $200 and $250 dependant on who you pick and where you live.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
