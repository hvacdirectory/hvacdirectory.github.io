<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
