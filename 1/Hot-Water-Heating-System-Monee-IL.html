<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and really small particles of dust.

<p>The first ac system and fridges utilized hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
