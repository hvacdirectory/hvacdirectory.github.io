<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly might be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
