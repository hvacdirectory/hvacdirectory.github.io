<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
