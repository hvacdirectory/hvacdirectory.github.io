<p>For instance, problems occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient quantities of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or put in such a method that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly located outdoor air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.

<p>If no contaminant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air.

<p>If you have a big home, a house with high ceilings, a home with numerous windows or a home with inadequate insulation, heating your floors instead of the air may not be enough to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.

These changes might actually add up and possibly decrease your viewed requirement for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>Gas heaters do feature some downsides. The greatest disadvantage is likewise the outcome of the combustion procedure.
