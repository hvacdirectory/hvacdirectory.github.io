When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install.

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same.
