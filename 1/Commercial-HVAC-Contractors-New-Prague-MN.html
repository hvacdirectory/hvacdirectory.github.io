<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new building and construction (houses usually use between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
