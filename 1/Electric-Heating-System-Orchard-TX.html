<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to save on costs (particularly at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores fluctuate beyond an appropriate variety that could prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>

Instead, the combustion is optimized by measuring the exhaust gasses and making clinical adjustments. This alone could pay for the whole maintenance check out at today's cost of gas.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
