HVAC professionals recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new.

A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
