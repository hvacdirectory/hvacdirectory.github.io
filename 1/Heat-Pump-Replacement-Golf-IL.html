<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Golf IL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
