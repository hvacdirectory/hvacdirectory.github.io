<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same duration. Generally, SEER supplies more information based on how the EER performs in different temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
