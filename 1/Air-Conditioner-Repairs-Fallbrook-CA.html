<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Companies in Fallbrook</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological pollutant. Biological contaminants in the house might include mold, germs, viruses, termites, and pollen. Bioaerosols launched into the air can be dispersed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause infectious diseases such as Legionnaires' illness.
