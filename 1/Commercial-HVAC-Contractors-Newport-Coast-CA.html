Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated home once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
