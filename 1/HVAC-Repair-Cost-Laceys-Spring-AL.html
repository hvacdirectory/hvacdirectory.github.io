If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on regularly might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
