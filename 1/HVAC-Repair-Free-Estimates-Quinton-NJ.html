<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
