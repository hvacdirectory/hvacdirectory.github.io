Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
