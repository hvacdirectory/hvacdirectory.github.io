<h3>HVAC Company in East Saint Louis IL</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
