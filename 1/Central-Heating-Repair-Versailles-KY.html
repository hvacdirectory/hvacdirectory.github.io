<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. Since they only partially eliminate the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon getting in the home, the efficiency of these devices is unpredictable.

EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies more information on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air contaminants.<p>
