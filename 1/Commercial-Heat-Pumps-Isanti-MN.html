<p>Property owners might also assume that due to the fact that a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a house enhancement, its installation will right away raise their house's value. No proof exists recommending that in-floor heating either positively or adversely affects home values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Magazine. Perhaps Realtors need to think about too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may contribute to, or deduct from, any offered asking rate. That stated, homebuyers aiming to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
