This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room a/c offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air.<p>
