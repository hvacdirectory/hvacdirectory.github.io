<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While room cooling supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
