<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was type of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we fixed problems. I would advise this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

Possibly Realtors need to consider a lot of variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system may add to, or deduct from, any provided asking cost. That stated, property buyers aiming to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating system will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
