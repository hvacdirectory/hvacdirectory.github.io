Lastly, after a rigorous choice process, the space agency chose Dometic. We've had a great deal of firsts over the years, however this custom task provided unique challenges for our engineers," said a spokesperson for Dometic.

Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
