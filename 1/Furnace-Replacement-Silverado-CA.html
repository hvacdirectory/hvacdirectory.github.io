<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
