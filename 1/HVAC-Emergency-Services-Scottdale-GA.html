<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company in Scottdale GA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
