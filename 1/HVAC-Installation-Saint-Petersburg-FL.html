<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth doesn't necessarily equate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The ventilation, heating and air conditioning service tends to run cold and hot. Demand warms up throughout the summertime and winter when clients require their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather arrives.<p>
