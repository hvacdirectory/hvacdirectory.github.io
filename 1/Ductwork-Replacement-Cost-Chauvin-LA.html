<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
