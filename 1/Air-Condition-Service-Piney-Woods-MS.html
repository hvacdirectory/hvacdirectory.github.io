<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, considering that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
