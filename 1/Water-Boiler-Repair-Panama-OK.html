<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants given off by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside may trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
