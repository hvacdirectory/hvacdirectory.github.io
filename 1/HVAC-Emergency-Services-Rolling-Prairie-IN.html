<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually found the problem area in examining the bill.

<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, especially if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed regularly, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to. The heating and cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will get worse. Inspecting and altering the air filters is one of the most important elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months before the existing one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
