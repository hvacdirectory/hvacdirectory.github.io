<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they simply didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
