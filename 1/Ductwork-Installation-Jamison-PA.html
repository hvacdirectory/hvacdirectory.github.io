<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Heatpump are a dream become a reality for folks in Seattle.

The finest time to install air conditioning in your house might very well be when your heating system breaks down if a heat pump is in your future.<p>
