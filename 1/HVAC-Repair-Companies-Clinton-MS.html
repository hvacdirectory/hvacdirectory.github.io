<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
