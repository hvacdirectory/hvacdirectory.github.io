<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

Permeable products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and need to be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding.

Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
