<p>Expert heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy new.
