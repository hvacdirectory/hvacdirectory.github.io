<p>Keep in mind that the SEER score is computed using the exact same set of temperatures throughout the board. The average summertime temperature level to come to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to reach the right SEER ranking for your location, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c units manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to trigger the health effects pointed out. However, it is not always real that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health impacts is too restricted to identify the levels at which the listed effects might take place.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t appropriately detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
