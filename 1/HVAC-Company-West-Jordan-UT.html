<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
