Ask your heating contractor for the most appropriate option.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their performance in time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
