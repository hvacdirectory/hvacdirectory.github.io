<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
