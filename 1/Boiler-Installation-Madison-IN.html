<p>All Points Heating uses house air conditioning, a/c unit installation, a/c unit maintenance that deliver trusted, proven efficiency at high efficiency. Combustion items from auto exhaust, heaters, hot water heater, area heaters, scented candles, oil lamps, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not correctly vented can create carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
