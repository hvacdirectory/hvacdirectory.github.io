I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
