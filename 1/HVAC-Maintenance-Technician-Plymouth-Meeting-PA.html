<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this enter the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements too. Split systems are ideal for cooling several spaces at once, but are not extremely energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the very same time, the con would be that those who use this may invest more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
