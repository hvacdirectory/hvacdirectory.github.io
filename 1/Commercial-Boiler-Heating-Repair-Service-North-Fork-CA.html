<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
