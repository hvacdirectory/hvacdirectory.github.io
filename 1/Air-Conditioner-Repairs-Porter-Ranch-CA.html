<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.
