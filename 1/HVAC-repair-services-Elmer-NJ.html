<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales guy concerns your house he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the choices for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
