<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and structure occupants may be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace machines, cleaning products, building activities, furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
