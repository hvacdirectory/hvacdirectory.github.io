<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>They have not conventionally used virtual or remote services because HVAC service technicians require to be physically present to do their work.

<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
