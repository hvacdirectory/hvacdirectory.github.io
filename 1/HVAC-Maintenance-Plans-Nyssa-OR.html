<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>You could upgrade to the highest efficiency gear available and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are just part of the central air system.

Prior to deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air escapes the system.<p>
