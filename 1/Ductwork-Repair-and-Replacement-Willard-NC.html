<p>Oil heating systems are generally not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but the majority of do not achieve a performance higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
