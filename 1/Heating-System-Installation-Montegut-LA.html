The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
