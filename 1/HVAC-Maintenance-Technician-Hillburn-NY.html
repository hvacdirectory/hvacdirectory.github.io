<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
