<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they must be put.

Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll require to position the sensor appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside buildings are usually near the ceiling.
