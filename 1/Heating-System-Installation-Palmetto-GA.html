<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might see musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues.

But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>

Such information can in some cases be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Review of this data may recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
