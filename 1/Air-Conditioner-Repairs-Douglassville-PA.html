<h3>Central Heating System in Douglassville PA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
