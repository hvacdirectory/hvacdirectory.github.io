Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
