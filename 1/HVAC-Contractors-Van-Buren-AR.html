While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>

<p>You could upgrade to the highest performance equipment available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The average house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air prior to it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>

<p>Certain instant effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically hard to identify if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination.
