<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
