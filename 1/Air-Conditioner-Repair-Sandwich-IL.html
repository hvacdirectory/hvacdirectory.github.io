One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface area.

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
