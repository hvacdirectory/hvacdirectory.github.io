<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many AC systems come with a variety of special features that can further improve performance and efficiency.
