<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
