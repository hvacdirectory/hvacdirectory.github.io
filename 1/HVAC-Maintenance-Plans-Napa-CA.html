<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean significant cost savings in yearly heating costs.

If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
