<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
