<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall.

Since they don't require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
