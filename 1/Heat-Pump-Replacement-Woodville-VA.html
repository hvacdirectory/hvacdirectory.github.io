These convection heaters are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
