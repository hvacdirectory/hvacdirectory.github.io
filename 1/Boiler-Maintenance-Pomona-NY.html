<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
