For this factor, it is necessary to take notice of the time and location the symptoms occur.

<p>A specific air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
