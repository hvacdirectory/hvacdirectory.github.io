<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to examine situation & chose to opt for them for the work.

<p>Through normal use and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c unit may become really dirty. These aspects of the devices are vital for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans all parts, and examines connections to ensure they are protected. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic elements are examineded for proper function and general condition. This is an outstanding opportunity to identify parts that are worn or faulty. Changing them to fix the air conditioning may be a lot more economical when the problem is fairly minor.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
