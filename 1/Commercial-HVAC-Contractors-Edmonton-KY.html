<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Edmonton KY Home</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require reasonably little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is essential to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed periodically to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in hard water locations). The systems must be examined a minimum of two times per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust collected in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
