<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>When installing radiant heat, you must provide severe thought to the type of floor covering in the house. Since it performs and shops heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, however work fairly well. Carpeting will straight insulate the flooring from the room, reducing efficiency, so if you want to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with thick cushioning.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>

However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are generally not really efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not attain an effectiveness greater than 90%.
