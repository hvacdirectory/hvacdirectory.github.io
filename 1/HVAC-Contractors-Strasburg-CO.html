The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>. Prior to choosing the installation area of a/c unit, several main factors need to be thought about.

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can often be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer.
