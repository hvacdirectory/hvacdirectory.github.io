<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Terrace Park OH</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
