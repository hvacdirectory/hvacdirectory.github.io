<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To spot smells in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Just a professional can accurately diagnose why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears odd or you lose confidence, it's time to call an expert. Similarly, if the procedure does not work, something else is wrong and you require a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you discover you need to do it often, it's most likely time for a professional opinion.<p>
