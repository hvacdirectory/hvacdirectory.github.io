<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is truthful, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to discover an honest AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
