<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many people.<p>
