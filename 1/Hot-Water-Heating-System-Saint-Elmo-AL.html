<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed.

However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture indoors is related to a greater prevalence of resident respiratory problems.<p>
