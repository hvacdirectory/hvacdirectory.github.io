<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of numerous) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and performance if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the extremely hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
