<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
