Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact.
