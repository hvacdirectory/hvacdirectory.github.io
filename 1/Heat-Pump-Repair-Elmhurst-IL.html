<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can likewise exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be infected (because of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread these toxins throughout the home.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that perfect temperature throughout the year.
