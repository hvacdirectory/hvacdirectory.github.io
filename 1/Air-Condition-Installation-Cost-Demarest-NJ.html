Not just will blocked vents and signs up affect your comfort, they can also cause duct leakages due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a great concept. You will not save any extra money and will end up causing more problems for your heating system.<p>
