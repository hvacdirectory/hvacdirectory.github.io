<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power must not surpass the capacity of the outside system.

Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, considering that the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, given that it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
