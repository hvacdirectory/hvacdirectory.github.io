<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Cleaning in Velarde NM</h3>
<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially costly to set up, particularly in an older home. Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're highly allergic to dust. In addition, particular fuels and devices may require special licenses, and there is limited versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating system to the home.<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
