<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets.
