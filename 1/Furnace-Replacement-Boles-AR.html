<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial impacts. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon individual sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
