<p>Geothermal heating is among the most effective heating sources in regards to environmental costs. It protects the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or toxins because the energy utilized to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in fridges. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical energy, they release far less greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating unit that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and fixed really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
