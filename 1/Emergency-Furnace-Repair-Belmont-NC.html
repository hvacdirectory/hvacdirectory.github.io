<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold love wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other irritants under control. A dehumidifier (and a/c during summer season) helps reduce wetness in indoor air and successfully manages allergens, Lang says. An air conditioning unit also decreases indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -sufferers.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While space air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
