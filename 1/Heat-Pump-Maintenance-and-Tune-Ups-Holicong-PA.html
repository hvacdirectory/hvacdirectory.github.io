<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
