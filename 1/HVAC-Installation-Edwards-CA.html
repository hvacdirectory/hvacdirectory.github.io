<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Lots of people are becoming more conscious and worried about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of contaminants and irritants can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Occasionally it needs to be eliminated to refresh the quality and improve of indoor air and enhance the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the air ducts physically by eliminating the particles from the air filter.<p>
