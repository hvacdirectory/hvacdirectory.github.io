<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
