<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the abilities or tools essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>
