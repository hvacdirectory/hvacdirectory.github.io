<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
