<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Hookerton NC</h3>

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.
