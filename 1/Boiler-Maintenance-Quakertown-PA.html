<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
