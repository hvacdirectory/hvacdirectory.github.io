Because it just takes more electricity to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
