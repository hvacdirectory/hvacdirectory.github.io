<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation.
