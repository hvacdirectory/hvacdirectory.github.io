<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might see musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>

After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
