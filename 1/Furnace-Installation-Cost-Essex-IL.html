<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be allowed to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.<p>
