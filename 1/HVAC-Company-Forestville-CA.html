<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make certain that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
