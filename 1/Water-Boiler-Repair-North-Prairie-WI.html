This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
