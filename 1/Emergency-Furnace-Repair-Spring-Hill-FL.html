<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to assess and, if essential, update the building envelope.
