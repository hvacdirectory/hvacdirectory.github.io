<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
