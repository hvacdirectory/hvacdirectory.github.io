<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
