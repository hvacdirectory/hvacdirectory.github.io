<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, because the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
