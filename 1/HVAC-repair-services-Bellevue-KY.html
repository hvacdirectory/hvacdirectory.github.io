<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
