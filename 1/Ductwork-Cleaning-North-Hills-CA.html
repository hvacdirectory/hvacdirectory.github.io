<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window.
