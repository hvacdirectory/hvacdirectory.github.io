<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out repairing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
