<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
