My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

However I do not find that there is a central area for searching information about the "real" value of home HVAC systems or possibly I should say a truthful evaluation of these products.
