<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Often a short-lived indoor air quality problem is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated problems-- identified by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 techniques listed below might be suitable.<p>
