Since it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
