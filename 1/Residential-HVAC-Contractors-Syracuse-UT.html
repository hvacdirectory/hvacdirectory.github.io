<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
