<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
