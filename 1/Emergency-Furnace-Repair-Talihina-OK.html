<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can suggest your home might not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Think about potential impacts of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the maker's directions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
