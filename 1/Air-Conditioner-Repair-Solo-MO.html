<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which instantly shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
