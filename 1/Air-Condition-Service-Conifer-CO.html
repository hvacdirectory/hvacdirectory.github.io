<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
