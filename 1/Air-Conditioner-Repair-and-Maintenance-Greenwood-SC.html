<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
