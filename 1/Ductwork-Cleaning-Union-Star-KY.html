<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>In general, ductless AC systems are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than conventional HVACs. Due to the fact that you can turn off individual spaces when you're not occupying them, this is. On top of that, ductless ACs can raise and decrease their temperature easily, saving you energy and cash that routine HVAC compressors will waste by constantly launching and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually spotted the problem area in looking over the expense. He dealt with the problem in one day, had changed the costs to what I thought about fair prior to he recalled, knew what might have triggered the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not occur once again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
