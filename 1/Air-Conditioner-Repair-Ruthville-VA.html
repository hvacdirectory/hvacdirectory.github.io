<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
