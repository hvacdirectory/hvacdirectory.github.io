<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
