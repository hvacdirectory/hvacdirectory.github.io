<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
