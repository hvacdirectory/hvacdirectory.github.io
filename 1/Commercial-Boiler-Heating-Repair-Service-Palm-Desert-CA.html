<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Palm Desert CA</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is sincere, reliable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
