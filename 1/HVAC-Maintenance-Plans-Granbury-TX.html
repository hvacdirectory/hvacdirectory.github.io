PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room cooling offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
