<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
