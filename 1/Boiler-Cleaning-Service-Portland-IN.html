<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is frosty.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While space a/c supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
