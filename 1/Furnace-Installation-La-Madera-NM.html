<p>Due to the fact that they remove moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
