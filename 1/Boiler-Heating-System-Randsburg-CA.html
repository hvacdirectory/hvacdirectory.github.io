<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money can be found in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from.
