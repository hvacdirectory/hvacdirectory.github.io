<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.

Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, resulting in holes and cracks. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
