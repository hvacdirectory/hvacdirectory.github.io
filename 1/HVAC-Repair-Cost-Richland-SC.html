<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in Richland SC</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings can not be effectively determined or fixed without an extensive structure investigation.

<p>The split system is the most typical. The majority of people are used to seeing this enter the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal components also. Split systems are perfect for cooling several spaces at once, but are not very energy efficient.
