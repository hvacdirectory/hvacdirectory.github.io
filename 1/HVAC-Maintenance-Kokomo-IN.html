<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the existing one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
