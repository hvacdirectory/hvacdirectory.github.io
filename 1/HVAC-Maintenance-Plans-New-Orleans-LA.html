<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires managed by specialists, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
