<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>To start, it's an excellent idea to think of energy efficiency. By selecting a central AC system that has as high of an efficiency rating as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and save money in the long run. Effectiveness rankings need to be identified with all units. While efficient systems might cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated device is a great method to enjoy additional comfort.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your home is located, the local region's environment can change drastically. A house situated in the South would require an AC system with a size capable of cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would need a much bigger heating capability also which will affect costs. See the chart below for the average central air conditioner replacement costs by LOTS.<p>
