He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have fulfilled in a long time.

<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly pricey to set up, especially in an older house.
