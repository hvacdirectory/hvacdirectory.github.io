A healthy and comfortable home environment requires an energy-efficient and safe heating system. One that heats the house without utilizing large amounts of energy which does not endanger the indoor air quality.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time indoors, these days. While many individuals presume pollution is just an outside problem, your home (and workplace) can likewise be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we do not believe sufficient about exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you have actually given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
