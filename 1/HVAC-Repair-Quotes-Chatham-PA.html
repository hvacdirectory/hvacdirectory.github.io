<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
