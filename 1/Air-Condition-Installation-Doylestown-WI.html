<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up simply a couple of years earlier.<p>
