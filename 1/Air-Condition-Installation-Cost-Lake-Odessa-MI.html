After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
