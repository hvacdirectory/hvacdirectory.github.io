<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
