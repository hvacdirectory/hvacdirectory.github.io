<p>The installation was quickly, professional and very well done. The installers were respectful and knew exactly what to do.

<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
