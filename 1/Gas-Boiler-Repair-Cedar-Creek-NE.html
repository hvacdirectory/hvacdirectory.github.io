<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by most public water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you have actually tested the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, call a laboratory certified to measure radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon issues in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>When you buy a new heating and cooling system, you're buying your home, your household, and your organisation. You are worthy of to know who will show up, how they will look, and have confidence in the company you've worked with. We hear all the time about questionable vehicles showing up with people who can't communicate well, aren't expert, and leaves you wondering what you simply invested your money on.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>No matter the kind of electric radiant floor heating unit, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or modified. Any disturbance or interruption in the circulation of electrical power makes the system unusable. This is one of the downsides to setting up an electric radiant heat system. Nevertheless, assuming they are set up correctly and effectively taken care of, the likelihood of them having problems is small.<p>
