<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used commonly in a variety of structure construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant.

Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
