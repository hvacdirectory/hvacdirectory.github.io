<h3>Repair and Care for Hillsdale NJ Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very happy that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>

Next, examine other elements of the furnace for any accumulation of dust, particles and dirt, an inexpensive repair that can assist increase performance.
