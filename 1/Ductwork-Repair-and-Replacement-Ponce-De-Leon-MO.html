<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
