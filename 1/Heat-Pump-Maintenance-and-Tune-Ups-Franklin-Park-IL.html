However, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same).

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
