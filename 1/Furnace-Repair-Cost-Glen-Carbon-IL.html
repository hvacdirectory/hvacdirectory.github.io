<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
