Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
