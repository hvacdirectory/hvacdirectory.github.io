<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Collierville TN</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>There are several variables that add to indoor air contamination. Such factors consist of using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide emitted by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls consisted of in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
