Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does offer standards about the most common IAQ work environment problems.<p>
<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the inspection on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health threat reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a new property owner I have actually learned how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
