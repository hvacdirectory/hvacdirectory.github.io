<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the air conditioner to work well.

Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
