<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's an easy problem like debris blocking the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing devices, however also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your house.
