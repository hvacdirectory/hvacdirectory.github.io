<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally brought on by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main problem in majority the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually carried out. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the same to be real. These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is very important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The toxins noted in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health impacts discussed.
