<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
