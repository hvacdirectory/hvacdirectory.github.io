Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
