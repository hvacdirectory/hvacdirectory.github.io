This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
