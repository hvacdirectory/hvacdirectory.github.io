<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness indoors is related to a greater prevalence of occupant breathing problems.<p>
<p>We have been incredibly happy with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system).
