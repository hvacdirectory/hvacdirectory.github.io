<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
