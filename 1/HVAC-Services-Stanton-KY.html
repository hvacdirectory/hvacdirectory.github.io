<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>
