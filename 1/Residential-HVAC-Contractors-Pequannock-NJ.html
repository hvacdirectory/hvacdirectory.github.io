<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

Our team does outstanding work, whether it's handling conventional HVAC work or handling the peculiarities of brownstones, prewar structures and other structures not easy to heat or cool.<p>
<p>We have been using Keefe's for several years and have actually constantly been extremely pleased. They provide outstanding repair install and the customer support is fantastic.

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
