<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your house, providing a comfy climate in every space. But ducts that are not installed appropriately or maintained can distribute contaminants from one room to another. In time, dust, dander and even mold can build up in your ducts, reducing the general air quality. Work with a professional to make sure your ducts are distributing fresh, clean air.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
