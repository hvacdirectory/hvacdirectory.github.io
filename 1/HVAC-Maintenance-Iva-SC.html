<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
