<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
