These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.
