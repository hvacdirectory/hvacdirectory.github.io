<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had identified the trouble location in looking over the expense. He resolved the concern in one day, had actually adjusted the expense to what I considered fair before he called back, understood what might have caused the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not happen again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air.

Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, humans exhale co2, which in little amounts is not poisonous, however may become hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate.
