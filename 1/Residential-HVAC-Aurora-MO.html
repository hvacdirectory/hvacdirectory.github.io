Based upon the typical temperatures in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years.

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in explaining what services would be carried out. Also Camryn provided terrific customer support at the end of the appointment by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
