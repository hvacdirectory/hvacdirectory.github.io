<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
