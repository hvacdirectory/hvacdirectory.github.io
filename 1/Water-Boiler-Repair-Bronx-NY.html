What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
