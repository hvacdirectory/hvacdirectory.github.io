<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one component (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the system running.

Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
