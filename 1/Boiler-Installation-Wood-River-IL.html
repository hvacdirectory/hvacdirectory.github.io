However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
