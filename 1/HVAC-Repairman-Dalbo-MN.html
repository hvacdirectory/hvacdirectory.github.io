<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
