<h3>Working of an HVAC System in Palm Bay FL</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
