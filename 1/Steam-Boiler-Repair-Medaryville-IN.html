<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However many of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is committed to supplying a work environment that is free of acknowledged threats and to investigation complaints that might be connected to bad indoor air quality (IAQ). Though specific regulations have not been established for IAQ in the work location, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) thinks about suggestions from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Health Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and A/c Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>
