<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants set off allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing contaminants. Signs of health issue triggered by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
