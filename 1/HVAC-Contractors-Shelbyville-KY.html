<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Shelbyville KY</h3>
<p>Most people are aware that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can also have significant, harmful effect. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor levels of toxins may be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination among the leading five ecological health threats to the public.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface area of a flooring heats up the lower half of the space, covering occupants in heat at a lower total temperature-- sometimes as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heater." In other words, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of comfort. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
