The decision to change or repair is up to you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely uses higher energy efficiency and comes with warranty coverage.<p>

<p>There's a huge difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in cooler environments were warmed by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, floorings and ceilings heated up. In turn, the objects in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
