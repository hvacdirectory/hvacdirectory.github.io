<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
