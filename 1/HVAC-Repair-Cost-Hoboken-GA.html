<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
