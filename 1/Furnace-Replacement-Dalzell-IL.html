I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
