We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system before you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
