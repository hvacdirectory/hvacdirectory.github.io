<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust.

Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we recommend utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of allowing heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
