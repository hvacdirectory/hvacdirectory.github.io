Manufacturers normally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard enters into impact.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
