<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
