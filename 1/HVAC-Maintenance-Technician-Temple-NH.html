<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
