<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain.

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative study discovered. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
