<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
