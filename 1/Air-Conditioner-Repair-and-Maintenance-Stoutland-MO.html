<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior.

<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
