Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater.

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy.
