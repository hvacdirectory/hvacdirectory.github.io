<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best choice for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
