<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside.

<p>Usually the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions.

To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
