<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other contaminants that can not just unclean up the air, but cause other health problems.

<p>Usually the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions.

The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
