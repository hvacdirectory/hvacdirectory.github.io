<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Not just was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
