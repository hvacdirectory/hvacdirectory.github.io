<p>. Before selecting the installation place of air conditioning unit, numerous primary factors require to be considered. Firstly, the instructions of air flow from the indoor systems must not fall on the location of rest or workspace.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
