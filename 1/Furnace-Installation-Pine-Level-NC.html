<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by the majority of public water products, it has actually been found in well water. If you have actually evaluated the air in your home and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, call a lab licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon issues in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
