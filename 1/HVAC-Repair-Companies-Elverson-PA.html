<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Elverson PA</h3>
<p>Variable speed is the way to go if it's time to upgrade an aging AC. Currently planning to change an existing air conditioning system?

At the minimum, consider a 2 phase compressor for improved comfort and effectiveness.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>The primary reason property owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services offered. If the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any major repairs need to be covered under the maker's warranty. However, some producers need routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
