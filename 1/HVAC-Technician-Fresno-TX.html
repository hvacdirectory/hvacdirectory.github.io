A ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions.

Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
