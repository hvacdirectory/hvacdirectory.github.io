<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
