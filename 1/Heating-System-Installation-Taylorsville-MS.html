We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for financial freedom.
