<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
