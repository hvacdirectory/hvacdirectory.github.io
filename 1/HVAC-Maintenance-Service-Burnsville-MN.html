<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies.

<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Burnsville MN</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
