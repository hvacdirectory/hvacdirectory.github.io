<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repeated usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, causing holes and fractures. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
