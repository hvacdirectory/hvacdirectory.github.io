<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
