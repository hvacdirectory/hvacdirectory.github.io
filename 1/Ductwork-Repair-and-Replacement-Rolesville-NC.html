<p>Seattle furnaces can run nine months of the year. Based on the typical temperature levels in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years. Your heater will strive for you, however like your cars and truck, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running efficiently, prevent issues, and keep your service warranty undamaged.<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle.
