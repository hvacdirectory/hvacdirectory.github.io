<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.
