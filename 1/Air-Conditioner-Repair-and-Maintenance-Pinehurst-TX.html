<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and healthcare facilities, vehicles such as automobiles, trains, submarines, aircrafts and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
