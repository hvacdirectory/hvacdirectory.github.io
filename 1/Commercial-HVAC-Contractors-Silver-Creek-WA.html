<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that best temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service strategy which normally consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
