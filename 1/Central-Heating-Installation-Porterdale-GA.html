<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
