<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
