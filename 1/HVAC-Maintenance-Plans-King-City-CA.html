<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
