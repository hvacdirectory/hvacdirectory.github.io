Such info can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
