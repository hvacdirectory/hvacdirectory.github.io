<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Frisco TX - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
