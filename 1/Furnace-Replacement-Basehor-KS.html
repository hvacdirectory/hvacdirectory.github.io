<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, considering that it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
