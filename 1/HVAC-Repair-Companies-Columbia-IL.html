<p>Radiant heat offers a number of special advantages over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.

<p>If you are changing your existing air conditioning system, it's safe to presume that you currently have actually ductwork installed.

<p>Radiant heating unit don't make use of ducts, which makes them a fair bit more energy effective than other systems. They also don't produce cold and hot areas. All of the heat that radiant heat systems distribute relocations through strong objects, keeping the heat near the flooring of the room where it is the most use.

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Room a/c unit feature a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control panel, which measures the temperature level of air entering into the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the ac system might cycle continuously or behave erratically. The sensor needs to be near the coil but not touching it; change its position by thoroughly bending the wire that holds it in location.<p>
