<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems feature a variety of unique features that can even more enhance efficiency and performance.
