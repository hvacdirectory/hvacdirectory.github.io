<p>Among the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is since something is stopped up or dirty Prior to attempting to fix any issue, take time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is good to go, examine the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, get in touch with a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance.
