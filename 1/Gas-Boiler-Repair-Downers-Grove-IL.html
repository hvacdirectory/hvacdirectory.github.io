<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in sufficient quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a way that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Incorrectly located outdoor air consumption vents can also generate air polluted with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.

<p>Some HVAC professionals offer service agreements to their clients, providing regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems. In some circumstances, other tradespeople will work with HVAC techs to help install or repair cooling and heating unit.

<p>Outside impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers.
