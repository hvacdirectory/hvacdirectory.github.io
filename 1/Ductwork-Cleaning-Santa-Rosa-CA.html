<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys.
