<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Sun Prairie WI</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
