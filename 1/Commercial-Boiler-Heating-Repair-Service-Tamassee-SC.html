<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
