<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will frequently build up in ductwork, restricting air flow. Since ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear very overwhelming initially, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and know-how.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with debris that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency.

By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
