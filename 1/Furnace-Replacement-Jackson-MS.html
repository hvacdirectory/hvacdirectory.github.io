<h3>Electric Heating System in Jackson MS</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>There are some more severe dangers for HVAC workers that could be possibly deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be harmful.
