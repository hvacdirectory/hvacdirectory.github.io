<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
