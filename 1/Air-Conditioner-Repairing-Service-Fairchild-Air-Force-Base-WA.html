<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Fairchild Air Force Base WA</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
