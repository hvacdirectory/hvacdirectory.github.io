<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
