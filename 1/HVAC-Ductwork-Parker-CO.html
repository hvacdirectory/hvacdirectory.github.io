<h3>Solar Heating System in Parker CO</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were handy and informative, Ballard Gas offered us a much better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and situated methods we could have more even heat. He included these significant however small changes in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump due to the fact that of current warmer summers and for environmental factors.<p>
