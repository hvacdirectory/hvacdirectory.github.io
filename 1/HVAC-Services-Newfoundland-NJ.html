<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
