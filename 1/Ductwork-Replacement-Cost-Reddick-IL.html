<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Reddick IL</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a few years ago.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
