<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Deer AR</h3>
<p>I was very happy in the start because things ran efficiently with no noise. Additionally, I saw visible changes in my electricity bills. After two years, things began to change. There have been awkward sounds. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has been a great experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. But then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
